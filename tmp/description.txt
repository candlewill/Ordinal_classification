5. System specs

- 5.1 Core approach

We train LSTM-CNN model to capture the sentiment score of tweets. A linear regression layer is on the top of the model.

- 5.2 Supervised or unsupervised

Supervised

- 5.3 Important/interesting/novel features used

All the features are learned by LSTM-CNN model automatically. We did not use other lexicon or n-gams features.

- 5.4 Important/interesting/novel tools used

Keras package is used to build our model, which can be speed up with a GPU. Pre-trained word vectors from GloVe are used as initial parameters of the embedding layer in our model.

- 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing

All the tweets are lower cased and all punctuation in sentence are removed.

- 5.6 Other data used (outside of the provided)

Vader Twitter dataset [1] is used as additional training data, which containing 4,200 tweets annotated with sentiment ratings in [-4, 4] range.

- 5.7 Size of the training Twitter data used (some teams could only download part of the data)

The downloaded gold training set contains 654 “Not Available” tweets, which are directly removed when training. 

- 5.8 Did you participate in SemEval-2013 task 2?

NO

- 5.9 Did you participate in SemEval-2014 task 9?

NO

- 5.10 Did you participate in SemEval-2015 task 10?

NO
