181	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@Abdullahbats Here it's 1:20 PM, I can be around that time but maaaybe I'll be gone since I may watch Ant-man today
182	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@Braxwolf We're going to see Ant-Man tomorrow. I figured it would seem even better in comparison after watching this. :)
183	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@CoyJandreau @TheMattKey @SizzlerKistler just watched the show. Great show. Couldn't agree it's about Ant-Man. See ya Thursday
184	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@DANNY_DICKBLOOD Ant-Man was #1 for the 2nd straight week domestically.  Never has this been more apropos.  https://t.co/gQGlU5SLwt
185	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@EveLovelock1 Hi Eve, I hope you enjoyed Ant-Man! Saverday Tuesday is all day &amp; prices can be found here in future: https://t.co/FsOnBVYJyz
186	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@FB_BMB I went to see Mission Impossible Rouge Nation today, I really enjoyed it. Have u seen it? I might go see Ant-Man tomorrow?
187	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@FabrecIass I had high expectactions when I watched because everyone was hyping it so much, I knew Ant-Man would be good after 1st trailer
188	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@HeroesInColor00 you definitely aren't, Ant-Man was my 2nd favorite Phase 2 flick right after Winter Soldier
189	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@ItsNotAStar Took my son to see Ant-Man yesterday and the #ForceAwakens trailer played before. 1st time seeing it on big screen. #AWESOME
190	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@Jacksters26 Probably see Ant-Man at the cinema tomorrow. ) I hope you enjoy your tea, I'm certain you will. x
191	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@JayCyde There are a few winks in WINTER SOLDIER and ANT-MAN, various IRON MANs. Largely, though, you may be right.
192	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@NinDorkKnight @SpinelessOyster I am so hyped for tomorrow, the clip at the end of Ant-Man was enough to get me excited
193	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@ReesMarshall1 They are great aren't they - I have one from the Ant-Man wave coming tomorrow as I want to build the Ultron figure.
194	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@Rivulet027 Yeah, Ant-man fails on Jan and her daughter, but it's still a better movie than FF according to reviewers I trust.
195	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@RottenTomatoes Horrible. Diehard fans may love the hard R, but lots of people will pass. Ant-Man was fun, quirky, enjoyable. Not this.
196	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@Sartorial_Kai @LordXReshead  Na if they know wa good for them it will be like Ant-man, Mar-Vell would give Carol Danvers the mantle
197	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@SlyBibliomaniac yeah, on Friday I went and saw two movies people bitch about - Ant-Man and Minions. I had a good time! #HatersGonnaHate
198	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@ThePaddyMcB Fair enough. Unrelated, think I may go see Ant-Man again tomorrow if you're interested.
199	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@The_Xzav I'm gonna see Ant-man tomorrow, can't wait. (you seeeee, I'm doing theaters lol)
200	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@TshavhuThibe_ it's horrible, complete fail compared to the 1st movie. Rather watch Ant-man or Entourage.
201	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@VickieSmalley hoping to see Ant-Man tomorrow night at the Everyman in Reigate... Apparently it's been refurbished and is pretty good,
202	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@beanbagboy you and me both. Was chatting to @olwenhoff about 4th wall breaking after Ant-Man
203	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@jamess__paul Do you want to see Ant-Man on Tues?
204	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@lisak12009 my whole family is going to see Ant-Man on Friday before they leave though
205	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@marvelguy Love Winter Soldier. Incredibly close 3rd cause of its ramifications on the MCU. But I had too much fun with Ant-Man.
206	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@mirithejedi I finally saw Ant-Man on Tuesday I really enjoyed it, the movie was so good &amp; entertaining &amp; I enjoyed the Spider-Man reference
207	ant-man	UNKNOWN	@nkuchibhotla Then again, this is coming from the girl who just saw Ant-man for the 3rd time

216	ant-man	UNKNOWN	Ant-Man feels like a rough 1st draft of the Marvel universe (namely Iron Man) which it probably was, considering it's where it all started.
217	ant-man	UNKNOWN	Ant-Man felt like the 1st IronMan movie 2 me. That's good. It did feel like 2 films grafted onto each other. Not as good, but not bad either

2154	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@Sabithl  that photo is from just after Charlie Hebdo ,January !
2155	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@SamaelGore that's alright. Keep fighting the good fight &amp; as with Charlie Hebdo, long may the real France endure. A great people.
2156	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@Servane_A Just leaves me in tears - Charlie Hebdo was just in January. This is insane.
2157	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@SkumbagKrepo To be totally fair (not that he isn't a shit) this was in January, in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks
2158	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@Tamschi_ @CathyYoung63 I know it's from Charlie Hebdo, i know that they won't march now, it's a sentiment, that's all.
2159	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@TheyCallMePansy The tweet is from January, during the Charlie Hebdo crisis.
2160	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@Uber_Pix That photo was taken on January 7th of this year, shortly after the attack on Charlie Hebdo. Don't spread misinformation.
2161	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@WORLDSTARC0MEDY This is from the Charlie Hebdo attacks that took place on January 7th
2162	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@YungDonJon his 1st tweet after the attack was this. it's not unlikely he'd tweet that then after Charlie Hebdo https://t.co/mKrQvLIfwG
2163	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@airuhka3 It's from January in response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Misleading, I'll admit. But certainly an indication of character.
2164	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@aliceraee the Charlie Hebdo killers were French, so there's a high possibility these are French too. May as well just shoot everyone...
2165	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@ashalynd Apparently Trump (may have) made this comment back during the Charlie Hebdo attack and not this one.
2166	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@bettenkr This one is from the Charlie Hebdo but may give you some ideas https://t.co/TfgAGAjbae
2167	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@bfp1974 @therealcliffyb January 7th was the date of the last terrorist attack in Paris on the Charlie Hebdo magazine.
2168	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@biggsdaddycool those photos you're sharing of Parish with the "Not Afraid" are pictures from back in January after the Charlie Hebdo attack
2169	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@boyOfagirl I think it may be ideology, religion free and open speech (Charlie Hebdo) and yes bombing in Syria!!!
2170	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@chriscurleyLac and barely any news about it. Here is what they did little media coverage compared to Charlie Hebdo https://t.co/KMCT6lTax4
2171	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@crispybacon247 Look at the date. it was january 7 2014 after Charlie Hebdo. Don't be so willing to confirm your biases.
2172	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@edvaughan1 he actually made that tweet in January, not about yesterday. But it was just as shitty a comment at that time (Charlie Hebdo)
2173	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@erinmcunningham feeling the most convincing explanation is that it was the starting point of the Charlie Hebdo march
2174	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@ggiittiikkaa I wish and hope @tehseenp had same courage of convictions in writing to ISIS to march with Charlie Hebdo cartoons on T-shirt
2175	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@good @EmilyKnits @utopianpath Those are pictures from the Charlie Hebdo rallies in January, guys.
2176	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@iFighterPilot @soldier_pk may be that's the reason Charlie Hebdo was attacked in first place
2177	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@jimhejl WRONG. you need to fact check. Paris is on lockdown, bruh. This photo is after Charlie Hebdo in January.
2178	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@ladypunxxx whilst Trumps tweet is deplorable it was written in January post Charlie Hebdo. Look at the date on it
2179	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@lesleyabravanel @graceheIps May I just point out that even though DT's tweet was horrendous, it was after Charlie Hebdo on January 7th
2180	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@marthamaccallum I keep remembering idea in January that Charlie Hebdo attack, a fraction of the scale of this, might be a "game changer."
2181	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@naazrashid It may not be the best idea but *some* action is needed. School kids should not be calling for Charlie Hebdo to die @sofiaahmed1
2182	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@narendrapjoshi @ManiShankarIyer @INCIndia I believe this was from the Charlie Hebdo attack. Current attack happened Friday night.
2183	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@outmachicken @pgreysk 1st uneasyness was when he got v defensive about the Charlie Hebdo stuff, even tho he had pals patiently explaining
2184	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@stylinfunk @katyperry that's not True! It's a pic from the month of January after Charlie Hebdo. For the moment, it's forbidden to go out
2185	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	@tehseenp yes if you March with Charlie Hebdo with cartoons hand in hand with Taslima Nasreen
2186	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	After Charlie Hebdo murders, some people blamed the journalists. Hope they're ashamed: France now 2nd most dangerous country for reporters.
2187	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	Also, the 'not afraid' pictures are from after the Charlie Hebdo attack from January, not after the Parisian attacks.
2188	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	Analysis of last night's shocking #ParisAttacks by @jrug, who also covered the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January. https://t.co/pusYnZnjvr

2250	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	Yeah, #JohnKerry said the Charlie Hebdo attacks may have had "legitimacy" or at least a "rationale." Dude needs to stop. #ParisAttacks
2251	charlie hebdo	UNKNOWN	and they don't care about the finer points that may get in way of their tirades. Reactions to that Charlie Hebdo thing were esp instructive

2276	chris evans	UNKNOWN	Is Noel fielding having a chat on tfi Friday or is Chris Evans going to keep on rabbiting another break "groan"!!!
2277	chris evans	UNKNOWN	Is the Chris Evans show really bad this morning or is it Monday morning blues?

2285	chris evans	UNKNOWN	TFI Friday is just Chris Evans having a mid life crisis live on TV
2286	chris evans	UNKNOWN	TFI Friday was good in the 90s because it was new and Chris Evans was young.  Someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated.

3050	dana white	UNKNOWN	@ABQJournal Holly wants to fight before July; Dana White says "no"...so can White prevent Holly from earning until he says "okay"?
3051	dana white	UNKNOWN	@MMAjunkieRadio Hello its called dana white losing a massive amount of money because he put it all on Ronda.  People lost their shirts Sat.
3052	dana white	UNKNOWN	@Warden_AoS if Dana White had his head any further up her box he'd disappear. Joe Rogan, too. Fucking paper champion who had 1st real fight.
3053	dana white	UNKNOWN	@boxingrich regardless of what he may say, a former boxer smashing UFC's biggest star last night was Dana White's worst nightmare
3054	dana white	UNKNOWN	And the UFC is fucked up, Why you may ask? Because they are all getting hoed and controled by Dana White
3055	dana white	UNKNOWN	Biggest problem with UFC is that Dana White seems to feed sheep to lions for ticket sales. It's not exactly fixed but it may as well be.
3056	dana white	UNKNOWN	Dana White coming off as an asshole telling Holm's camp about immediate rematch in July &amp; she can't fight Tate. Selfish. What else is new.

4298	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
4299	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.
4300	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
4301	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring
4302	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
4303	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Are we taking bets on when Dustin Johnson has a meltdown at the PGA? Saturday? Sunday? #DustinJohnson #PGAChampionship #choke
4304	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...
4305	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?
4306	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
4307	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson dealt with another major disappointment after shooting +3 &amp; going from leading after 2 at -10 to being tied for 22nd &amp; at -7
4308	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday.
4309	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson having a complete meltdown on the 1st hole, on the green in 6 or 7 I've lost count. #PGAChampionship
4310	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is completely melting down. Sunday's just don't agree with him. #PGAChamp
4311	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is just a pig with this 3rd and 4th round play
4312	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately.
4313	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson isn't the first guy to drop 22 places in a major on Sunday, but it usually takes more than 1 hole. #PGAChampionship
4314	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson just can't do Sunday's
4315	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
4316	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson leading the #PGAChampionship ...until the 3rd round of course when he naturally falls apart.
4317	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson off to a flyer yet again! All he needs to do is stay off the coke on Saturday night.
4318	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful
4319	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
4320	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round
4321	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
4322	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Looks like Dustin Johnson won't be winning the pga championship after shooting an 8 on the 1st hole. #choke#PGAChampionship
4323	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Oh look dustin Johnson has blew up again lol. 7/4 after the 2nd round in places can now be backed at 50/1. #TheOpen #DustinJohnson #choker
4324	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Once again Dustin Johnson is leading early in the tourny, which means he has plenty of time to screw it up on ether Saturday or Sunday
4325	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them.
4326	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Well Dustin Johnson seems to have the anvil back in his bag on a Major Sunday. Dropped 20 spots on first hole. #SnowMan
4327	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Well, Dustin Johnson isn't really in contention but that won't stop him from royally screwing things up on the Sunday of a major.
4328	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!
4329	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	"What a weird day @PGAChampionship. 1st-round leader Dustin Johnson is 1 under thru 11 and falling down the board." @CameronMorfit Golf_com

4533	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	I like Dustin Johnson a LOT but I have no confidence in him closing out a major ---unfortunately he probably won't get a chance tomorrow
4534	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	I see 'Sunday Major Dustin Johnson' showed up today. +4 after the first... #roughstart #fightback #PGAChamp
4535	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	I swear Dustin Johnson is winning at the end of the 1st-3rd rounds of every golf major
4536	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch
4537	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	If the PGA tour just played Thursday Friday Saturday. Dustin Johnson would win every tournament
4538	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	If you could win a golf tournament on the 1st day, then Dustin Johnson would have 9 majors by now.
4539	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Is Dustin Johnson the best 1st round player of all time? @ksalvo21
4540	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Is the 12th playing down wind?  Because Dustin Johnson just hit a pitching wedge 150 yards.
4541	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	It may not be Sunday, but Dustin Johnson is still getting last round jitters. He's started with four bogeys! #DeutscheBankChampionship
4542	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	It's Thursday and Dustin Johnson is crushing it at a major. All is right.
4543	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	It's the Rd 1 Dustin Johnson show rearing its head again at another major. He leads by two, but Sat and Sun will tell the tale #PGAChamp
4544	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in 2nd, it's a good day
4545	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Just saw live scores amazing effort from Dustin Johnson to be back in 1st place, not surprising  Tiger with a 75
4546	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
4547	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Man if this guy could just do this on a Sunday. Dustin Johnson can just obliterate a golf course when he's on. Better make it 8000 yards.
4548	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Next time Dustin Johnson tees off on a Sunday in contention in a Major want him decked out in Godolphin blue #uspga
4549	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	No surprise: Dustin Johnson had a strong 1st rd Thursday at PGA Championship. Can he sustain it through weekend? http://t.co/goOqMTpsuy
4550	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Not sure I could muster the mental strength to play 17 more holes after  doing what Dustin Johnson just did on the 1st. #PGAChampionship
4551	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list.
4552	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Quality start for Dustin Johnson with an 8. He apparently is not a fan of Sunday golf. #PGAChampionship
4553	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
4554	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
4555	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	THIS OFFER ENDS TOMORROW!   Get Dustin Johnson to finish in the TOP 5 at 3/1 or Jordan Spieth at 5/1 when you join: http://t.co/q7W6jsOxvo
4556	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp
4557	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	The winner of the #PGAChampionship  will come from Thursday's 9:05 tee time (Jason Day, Dustin Johnson &amp; Rickie Fowler)   #Prediction #Golf
4558	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Things you can always count on on Thursday of a major:  Dustin Johnson leading; Tiger Woods over par.
4559	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	This Dustin Johnson start is going to be even better when he blows it on Saturday or Sunday.
4560	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Tomorrow I'm doing the coolest thing of my life. I'm going to be in a Taylormade commercial as Dustin Johnson's playing partner!!!
4561	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Watching Dustin Johnson on Saturday and Sunday is amazing. The guy just can't do it. Ever
4562	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Wayward driver puts Johnson off the PGA pace  The horn may have been a welcome sound for Dustin Johnson.  http://t.co/HB9GmCNTSr
4563	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Well I pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th but I'm proud to say I played the best 9 holes of my life tonight #GoLow http://t.co/zBZR1EfiZC
4564	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Will this be the major that Dustin Johnson finally grabs? http://t.co/h2zhhSrq6q via @golf_com
4565	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Would love to see Dustin Johnson make a huge charge tomorrow, he's got the game
4566	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Wow Dustin Johnson showing some true grit after quadding number one #PGAChamp especially since his history with major Sunday's
4567	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	see that dustin johnson is a co-leader right now. will take him serious if he is in top 3 on the final 9 sunday #pgachampionship
4568	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	so @PTI had WIlbon straight up making up a story about Dustin Johnson singing the 7th inning stretch last night with no correction, cool
4569	dustin johnson	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson again proves he may be best golfer on the planet on Thursday Friday and Saturday... just not good when matters most. #Sunday.

7204	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Saw Straight Outta Compton..and i didn't know Ice Cube wrote the script for Friday!
7205	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Scene in Straight Outta Compton of Ice Cube writing the script for Friday hilariously exemplifies how scattered the film's second half is.
7206	ice cube	UNKNOWN	So Ice Cube can give us Ride Along 2 but he can't give us another Friday movie with Chris Tucker.
7207	ice cube	UNKNOWN	So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck. Cause Ice Cube is crazy as a family sitcom. #StraightOuttaCompton https://t.co/dpyAmT7Ex9
7208	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Straight Outta Compton again... for the 3rd time. "Yeaah Yay!" (In Ice Cube's voice)
7209	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Straight Outta Compton the movie has to include a deleted scene of Ice Cube spittin the 1st verse on the song Straight Outta Compton on dvd
7210	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Straight Outta Compton's success hopefully convinces New Line Cinema to give Ice Cube the right budget for the last Friday movie.
7211	ice cube	UNKNOWN	Straight outta Compton made it look like Ice Cube wrote Friday... Or maybe he was just reading the script
7212	ice cube	UNKNOWN	That brief scene of Ice Cube writing Friday in Straight Outta Compton made me laugh cos it reminded me of Kenny Powers writing his script
7213	ice cube	UNKNOWN	That moment when you figure out Tia Long who played with Ice Cube in Are we there yet? Also played in Friday with Ice Cube #funfact

9669	justin bieber	UNKNOWN	if i woke up to Justin Bieber backstage passes tomorrow I'd make sure my mom got a million dollar mansion after I marry him.
9670	justin bieber	UNKNOWN	man tomorrow if my parents surprise me with justin bieber tickets I'll have a heart attack
9671	kane	UNKNOWN	#mufc really need to sort their shit out! No defenders &amp; attackers! Stones &amp; berahino or Kane, may not be the best yet but would take them
9672	kane	UNKNOWN	1st they're trying Kane &amp; now Derrick Rose. Yeah, OK. I call bullshit. Lie detector tests should be mandatory when it comes to rape charges.
9673	kane	UNKNOWN	2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later
9674	kane	UNKNOWN	@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander.
9675	kane	UNKNOWN	@AxAs23 it's pretty sad, Rooney may be the last one for a long time now unless players like sterling, Kane, stones, Wilson
9676	kane	UNKNOWN	@Callum_Kimber_C I don't know if I want to see a 3rd, I definitely don't want to see Kane
9677	kane	UNKNOWN	@Holtarna @BrentZBradshaw @SaveUsY2Jake Big Show and Kane have zero business finishing 3rd and 4th in the Rumble.
9678	kane	UNKNOWN	@Nick422 who hears that Kane may have sexually assaulted someone and thinks "I should call Chicago and see if he's available"? ugh
9679	kane	UNKNOWN	@PuckinHostile @GradHawksBlog @ChiSox_History as sick as it may sound, I hope Kane gets the indefinite suspension and Hawks get cap relief
9680	kane	UNKNOWN	@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November
9681	kane	UNKNOWN	@SpursOfficial @rapharris_ tomorrow better be a busy day or expect Kane to be fucked half way through.
9682	kane	UNKNOWN	@WinslowHorne @broach93 1. Agree, that dude is fast. 2. Wat. 3. Friday's. 4. Should've sold Kane when he was worth anything
9683	kane	UNKNOWN	@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...
9684	kane	UNKNOWN	@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!
9685	kane	UNKNOWN	@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt.
9686	kane	UNKNOWN	Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?
9687	kane	UNKNOWN	Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL
9688	kane	UNKNOWN	I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
9689	kane	UNKNOWN	I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
9690	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
9691	kane	UNKNOWN	No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents
9692	kane	UNKNOWN	Real shit vote Kanye for president if he really is doing it , can't stand Donald trump and Kane's my 2nd dad
9693	kane	UNKNOWN	Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
9694	kane	UNKNOWN	Spurs may aswell make use of adebayor,there paying him millions and there guna need someone when they realise Kane is a one season wonder
9695	kane	UNKNOWN	Toews backing Kane &amp; Voynov arrested by Immigration in US. Oh, tomorrow is going to be an icky NHL news/comment day.
9696	kane	UNKNOWN	Too early to sentence Kane.. he is actually shit but u nid 2 gv him time 2 shw up .. eben ladt year he got his 1st epl goals quite late
9697	kane	UNKNOWN	Would never vote for Kane for president, mostly with Kim Kardashian as his wife. No way in hell is she going to be the 1st lady
9698	kane	UNKNOWN	and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone.
9699	kane	UNKNOWN	@KingOBlackheath Kane and Rooney last night.....may have been the ugliest strike partnership of all time. Horrifying
9700	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7
9701	kane	UNKNOWN	Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck.
9702	kane	UNKNOWN	#ENG under investigation after fielding 12 players in the 2nd half. Turns out Kane's mate joined him on the pitch http://t.co/eMb3LHBPao
9703	kane	UNKNOWN	,.EXCLUSIVE.United targeting Anderson and Kane on deadline day but Sources reveal united may not risk flashing out big deals on deadline
9704	kane	UNKNOWN	.@schicflair Stardust as Gollum, Undertaker as Sauron, Kane as the Witch King, the Ascension as Uruk Hai, Wyatts as the Ring Wraiths  c'mon.
9705	kane	UNKNOWN	//Screw this, if Kane doesn't return tomorrow, he'll be back in the fall.
9706	kane	UNKNOWN	1st Giroud, now Kane, lol what a funny day #TOTEVE #Spurs #Everton
9707	kane	UNKNOWN	5 teams contact the Blackhawks about Kane... they dont seem to care they may lose him if he's charged ... winning that important to teams?
9708	kane	UNKNOWN	@AaronTHFC he will have to obviously otherwise just Kane for season. January won't be anybody for sale. Clubs don't need to sell.
9709	kane	UNKNOWN	@AdamOsper @tonyfowler4  Yes, I'm optimistic but feel we really needed a 2nd striker who could either play alone or link with Kane
9710	kane	UNKNOWN	@AdamOsper think you're mad. 6th is only possible if Kane repeats last years feat which is next to impossible
9711	kane	UNKNOWN	@AndrewGreif Concern's having 5th guy who can play CB; Kane's natural Safety but he played some CB in camp unless others like Tyree will 2/2
9712	kane	UNKNOWN	@Atomic_Moog @nick_elt @djc8008 swapping Kane for Giroud week 4. Hazard is a waste of coin as well so he may go next &amp; bring in Yaya or Kun
9713	kane	UNKNOWN	@BBCMOTD Kane should stop chasing da' goal, stay calm goals will come automatic, may be he'll get a hatick next game who knows
9714	kane	UNKNOWN	@BenSonicz Yea,i still rmmbr what Kane said, word for word,he was on stage he said 'AUSTIN,THIS SUNDAY THE BLOOD ON YOU WILL BE FOR REAL"
9715	kane	UNKNOWN	@BenjButton87 @scullytony @Poblfc @johns3boys @IBRWT just hearing Kane scored for England off to Spain tomorrow it's great to be alive#dubs
9716	kane	UNKNOWN	@BespokeDave MENTAL. The goals will be 2nd half when the subs come on. Kane will bag a couple I reckon.
9717	kane	UNKNOWN	@Bull_Diggy @WestHamMatters Toxic deserve 16th place and a season of turmoil in the boardroom plus Kane's struggles on the pitch #happydays
9718	kane	UNKNOWN	@CallumHaymes lamela was shite on Saturday and as for Kane it's no goals in 3, he scored final day of season against Everton remember
9719	kane	UNKNOWN	@CobesME4 we'll see when he scores the winner against you and is off to Man Utd with Kane in January. Enjoy Adebyor x
9720	kane	UNKNOWN	@Corrienationstr dunno. Ibra may not leave. Hes almost 34. Kane mayb but he looks off. Eithier a one season wonder or his head is turned
9721	kane	UNKNOWN	@Corrienationstr kane is a better then rooney with back to goal. rooney better sat just off
9722	kane	UNKNOWN	@EddyDavis19 and yeah I agree berahino may go on to be massive but with Kane at the club I'd focus on devolving him even more!
9723	kane	UNKNOWN	@EricWSoccer Yeah. In the case of England, when (I live in hope) they have Rooney, Sturridge, Kane and Welbeck fit they may be forced to
9724	kane	UNKNOWN	@GaffneyVLC Use Ade in Europa and Cups and let his contract run down. Best way to do it. Save Kane for league and get Berahino as 2nd ST
9725	kane	UNKNOWN	@Gentleman_THFC Bang him up front with Kane and play Sun and N'Jie on the wings then surely!
9726	kane	UNKNOWN	@GrimsToyShow grim did you know that Kane will return on Monday night raw
9727	kane	UNKNOWN	@HannahEckardt This is like my 3rd msg about this but im dumb. Do you know kane's # anymore? i lost it. Also hope everythings good and stuff
9728	kane	UNKNOWN	@Hostile_Derek @2ndCityHockey I don't know enough to say for sure, but he may make us not miss saad (if Kane isn't in prison)
9729	kane	UNKNOWN	@Iam_Stonewall I'm sure it's going to be Sting. Expecting a Brothers of Destruction reunion too Sunday with Kane helping Taker in his match.
9730	kane	UNKNOWN	@IdMjones Jesus. I CREATED? I said Kane may not reach the same heights. You then sent me 3 tweets asking my views on Martial in an attempt
9731	kane	UNKNOWN	@ImperialDesi Hawks will discipline Kane for sure. But he'll play again for the Hawks. May just have to wait a bit
9732	kane	UNKNOWN	@JGoldLabel Doubt it. Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar "Put him out" Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32
9733	kane	UNKNOWN	@JJPhyall @realBenReid I wouldn't be surprised with kane with sting possibly tomorrow
9734	kane	UNKNOWN	@JW_Burton Kane should of scored and would of made it easy then. Still hope always the important goal is the 1st mate. plenty of time
9735	kane	UNKNOWN	@Jason_Aldean  Kane just had his 6th heart surgery 4 wks ago-now he's home jamming! http://t.co/pfdzlQOx3R http://t.co/oyazi8VUdl
9736	kane	UNKNOWN	@JayAndreas @AnglesOfSupport @Sebby_Williams @CoachCKane I can call the lady cause Kane won't turn up till Thursday
9737	kane	UNKNOWN	@Kaneshow oh no Kane are you getting a divorce? I just listened to the replay of Tuesday's show and you said "bc of the divorce" WHHHAAAT?
9738	kane	UNKNOWN	@Keith_Russell @bensmith130 Both young, talented with potential. Kane's 1st season was ace, struggled since. Martial still raw.risks in both
9739	kane	UNKNOWN	@Keith_Russell Kane. Still remember the deadline day swoop for Berba. Something similar to happen on Tuesday, maybe?
9740	kane	UNKNOWN	@LeeCater94 he's a has been. One season wonder like Kane. He'll be gone come the end of the season when Chelsea finish 6th again.
9741	kane	UNKNOWN	@Lord_Sugar he will see him only to sign a cheque for me Pogba and Stones!.......careful, we may come for Kane as well
9742	kane	UNKNOWN	@LukeBBurgess not true. Kanes sitter, mason had 2 great chances and kane had another in the 2nd!
9743	kane	UNKNOWN	@MBTA happened a few minutes ago.. I believe the bus route was 49... If he went into other Kane's he may have hit firefighters
9744	kane	UNKNOWN	@MUFC_Hub buys and will make it easier for Kane to get goals not Top 4 contenders for me but 6th
9745	kane	UNKNOWN	@Mellealaw @ScottLevinWGRZ @sportsmockery @WGRZ Maybe she did.  She may not like being blamed for the accuser going to Kane's house.
9746	kane	UNKNOWN	@MoreMorley @sonyakennedy yeah but then again Kane has respect for Abby and still butts heads with her so it may happen
9747	kane	UNKNOWN	@MrsimonWilson1 Will text you the changes tomorrow who do you want to change Kane will check on Bertrand fitness
9748	kane	UNKNOWN	@Potters_1863 @APB1979 I definitely watch a different game than you. England 2nd best 1st half and not that good 2nd half Kane is difference
9749	kane	UNKNOWN	@RedPawRelief Kane, a dog in your care back in July, was found loose today in G-town. Can you help us locate the owner?
9750	kane	UNKNOWN	@RenoWallabout @juicysushi @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Chadli as a back up/3rd striker is not the worst thing to have. To replace Kane, no
9751	kane	UNKNOWN	@Ryan_Davis17 May not have been just find it strange... That's all. I just hope the same protection that came to Kane doesn't come to Rose.
9752	kane	UNKNOWN	@Shem_THFC We need a 2nd Str Target-Man too. To lead when Kane is out. Or to play Kane as a #10 with him. I see a deadline day Austin bid.
9753	kane	UNKNOWN	@Spurs2380 Kane may well get so disillusioned with lack of signings that he slaps in a transfer request. That would be interesting!
9754	kane	UNKNOWN	@THFC_Spurs KANE he may be ABLE he feckin aint what a touch for a bug man #kanescomedygold
9755	kane	UNKNOWN	@Teekosey I'm optimistic about Son. Looks like a great finisher and to have another goal threat may open up some space for Kane
9756	kane	UNKNOWN	@_Jayspurs @SPURSin140 @GlobalSpur well if thats the case the Kane and Eriksen got us out of the shit last season and got us 5th not Poch
9757	kane	UNKNOWN	@_Meredinho I just worry he could go either way 50/50,pretty much like Kane,hoping he has a most important 2nd season,need finished article
9758	kane	UNKNOWN	@andygoldstein05 I'll go Kane in......one of Mata, Fellani or Young going the other way. 2nd Benzema for DDG........warm or freezing? Neymar
9759	kane	UNKNOWN	@arby_18 @NHL_Campbell remember that day Chevy traded Bogo and Kane... Wonder if history could repeat itself. A 2nd p for p trade..
9760	kane	UNKNOWN	@benjiboodleboy and the fact you only have 10. Take it he's the missing 11th player behind Kane?
9761	kane	UNKNOWN	@biggersthebomb Seems to me like the Spurs gotta be careful because once Kane's contract runs out he may leave
9762	kane	UNKNOWN	@cartilagefree can Son and N'Jie give us what we need to supplement Kane until the January window?
9763	kane	UNKNOWN	@closetothegame Kane in EDM would be insane. If Kane went to MIN, MIN may finally be able to beat CHI in the playoffs
9764	kane	UNKNOWN	@davemeasures True, but I don't think Kane wants to leave. He's young and living the dream. Why would he go to United, to come 4th not 5th?
9765	kane	UNKNOWN	@dobbospurs88 I reckon Kane will get off the mark on Sat then he'll be buzzing again c
9766	kane	UNKNOWN	@fantasyleague @EwingCalvin Going to be at the Lane on Saturday and if he's not in the squad I'll be gutted... Kane needs help!
9767	kane	UNKNOWN	@hfialkov Thanks. Any credibility to Kane interest with Huberdeau as centerpiece? Or shall I just wait until tomorrow?
9768	kane	UNKNOWN	@hotspur423 as fans we should expect 6th and visible improvements in style. He will have to drop Kane for the cups now which is very sad.
9769	kane	UNKNOWN	@james_sussex tbh I also wanted to have him and Kane gain a partnership in case we need it 1-0 down and need a 2nd striker. No better game.
9770	kane	UNKNOWN	@juicysushi @ColinWaters @Inverted_FB @BenoitsSmartCar Kane gets hurt tomorrow. You really want Chadli/Son playing 99% of striker till May?
9771	kane	UNKNOWN	@julesss_x0 maybe he will let us go 3rd period to get it fixed. Or Kane's class
9772	kane	UNKNOWN	@leaham50 @_jaylawrence We started the window with 2 problem areas. Needing a 1st XI standard DM and a pacey ST as a Plan B/Back up to Kane.
9773	kane	UNKNOWN	@mank56 @TottenhamFC93 @STurner2011 if we get pace into the side and support Kane more then things may turn out ok
9774	kane	UNKNOWN	@mattyd1984 Yeah would be. Think Kane will retire soon, so that may happen with those two. Still got 8 months till Mania so we'll see.
9775	kane	UNKNOWN	@neilashton_ you red tops are so biased towards London clubs slagging Rooney off for not scoring then say Kane should be ENG 1st choice
9776	kane	UNKNOWN	@nicktheyid61 he may be able to scrape by just with the midfield but if Kane has a difficult time or injury I don't see enough goals in us
9777	kane	UNKNOWN	@pokeefe1 totally agree. After Levy's balls up with getting Berahino we may as well have used Ade as back up to Kane
9778	kane	UNKNOWN	@rocketrichman bizarre... Kane breaks a leg in training with England tomorrow, then what?
9779	kane	UNKNOWN	@russjohns8 @Slinger1970 @_LAPDOG  I've gotta admit I'm not too sure yet about Kane mysen... Got a lot to live up to after that 1st season
9780	kane	UNKNOWN	@ryanshoey Kane and bentaleb were always gonna breakthrough, too talented not to, Bentaleb should be 4th choice with class in front of him
9781	kane	UNKNOWN	@simonhfootball Yep, Kolarov and Wilson are two I want in for sure. May even get shot of Eriksen as Kane isn't scoring.
9782	kane	UNKNOWN	@sloader300 What were Mason's 2 good chances? Kane's 2nd (was that the one creeated by Chadli, where he had 4 bodies to shoot through)?
9783	kane	UNKNOWN	@spuddy1878 it's always against no doubt Kane will end his drought on Saturday
9784	kane	UNKNOWN	@spursycob @realdealdanny we gambled that team would stay third all season, just like we gambled kane alone would get us through 1st games
9785	kane	UNKNOWN	@spursycob That's the trouble. If they are decent &amp; Kane stays fit we may be 'ok'. If that doesn't happen then we are fucked. That simple
9786	kane	UNKNOWN	@stumpyspurs Man Utd may be forced to go in for Kane or even Austin if they can't lure bigger stars to the club.
9787	kane	UNKNOWN	@takerman15 I never once thought, it would be Kane until the last hr. people starting it may be Kane.
9788	kane	UNKNOWN	@thcoast @DanIrving95 take potential out of the equation is S.B. really a downgrade from Kane? i dont think so. his pace may B better suited
9789	kane	UNKNOWN	@tottenhamtalk1 Get him straight in the number 10 tomorrow night what you think? Son to Kane, Kane with the rabona pass to Son, Goal 2-0 Tot
9790	kane	UNKNOWN	@whoUthinkURiam Kane? And Aguero was surely better than Hazard maybe he gets 1st since he won the title
9791	kane	UNKNOWN	A district judge on Monday held Kane on charges for allegedly lying about leaking secret grand jury information to get back at her critics&gt;
9792	kane	UNKNOWN	A really unimpressive 1st half of football at Wembley (then again what do you expect.) can see Kane coming on early on. #ENGvSWI #England
9793	kane	UNKNOWN	Absolute must-read. Where the Kane investigation stands &amp; what could happen going forward.  #Blackhawks #PatrickKane https://t.co/Rb4bkTBIhz
9794	kane	UNKNOWN	After a delay late in the 2nd half team Kane trails team stamkos 14-15
9795	kane	UNKNOWN	Are we going to have a copy of Kane and lynch 2: dog days to play tomorrow?
9796	kane	UNKNOWN	As much as I want the Devils to take their Kovalchuk cash and go after Kane, it's really not the best move for right now. 6th seed at best.
9797	kane	UNKNOWN	Both Kane and The Undertaker pin Austin. . . Who's the champion? The world may never know. . .  #Breakdown98
9798	kane	UNKNOWN	Bradford's Logan Caruso was 2nd in the boys cross country race today in Kane with a time of 18:37, Hunter Yasurek of Kane was 3rd.
9799	kane	UNKNOWN	Cena may be gone from the arena, but u know someone's gonna runin this ceremony; but who, Kane? Sting? Someone new? WHO IS IT? @WWE #RAW
9800	kane	UNKNOWN	Chad, Kane &amp; S Burgoyne played in the guts with Lade at his peak in 07. Along with P Burgoyne those five took us to 2nd, but we lacked depth
9801	kane	UNKNOWN	Check out how Hurst, Kane &amp; Shearer got on, then come have a go at the Orient launch of #WalkingFootball on Sept 17! https://t.co/6Qwe6SsCCV
9802	kane	UNKNOWN	Christian &amp; Kane are ready on the Boom lounge at the @skillswestexpo you may even catch the MKR girls around, say hi http://t.co/kTyEtt9Oxc
9803	kane	UNKNOWN	Come on Kane, I have put you on my squad for 3 gameweek. Hahahah. And I will give you 4th,and 5th chance to prove. https://t.co/il4y4FspsY
9804	kane	UNKNOWN	Credit where it's due that is a good ball by Mason but I would say the ball is made by Kane's run. He'll score 2 in the 2nd half.
9805	kane	UNKNOWN	Damn.  My two fav Chicago athletes, Kane and D Rose, may be facing rape charges.  Hope neither is true...but if so...justice for the women.
9806	kane	UNKNOWN	Do you think Kane needs to switch gimmicks again? Should Kane get one more run?  #WWE #SoFarBackSunday #SFBS http://t.co/fw1TSxeZ7J
9807	kane	UNKNOWN	Dont know what all the worry about kane is for,we all know he doesnt start his season till november!#COYS
9808	kane	UNKNOWN	Drives me up a wall that I had to see a Kane article on him being traded on the front page of the Sun Times. Seriously? How dull are people?
9809	kane	UNKNOWN	Everyone jumping on Wazza's back before Wed night yet nothing been said about Kane?
9810	kane	UNKNOWN	Fair play to Kane, he managed to control the ball and score against virtually a sunday league keeper. Top notch
9811	kane	UNKNOWN	Going for England 3-0 tonight!  Kane 1st goal. ( if starts) #Eng
9812	kane	UNKNOWN	Good read (by @DTguardian) about Kane laughing off "one season wonder" comments: http://t.co/NgjNulL7BM
9813	kane	UNKNOWN	HAPPY for WILSON getting B'MOUTH 1st&amp;2nd GOALS... Saw him WORKING hard vs MUFC. But, SAD that ADEBAYOR no10 is NOW with KANE. @NigeriainfoFM
9814	kane	UNKNOWN	Harry Kane and Barkley are the most overhyped English talents going. 2nd season syndrome for Kane for sure
9815	kane	UNKNOWN	Hope Woy mixes it up for the game tomorrow,I'd start Butland, Rooney in the 10 role behind Kane. Bring Vardy and Barkley on when 5-0 up #Eng
9816	kane	UNKNOWN	How pissed off was I after doing Kane 1st goal England win 2-0 to find he wasn't even playing. 1st bet I've done since last time I won!!
9817	kane	UNKNOWN	I can see a masked Kane returning to cost Taker the match https://t.co/Q3ue9RgFD3
9818	kane	UNKNOWN	I could wait for the big DQ leading to the HUGE SIX MAN TAG MATCH - aw, c'mon Kane let me finish the damn tweet first #RAW
9819	kane	UNKNOWN	I read that Sun Times article and it did nothing to prove the theory that we should trade Kane.
9820	kane	UNKNOWN	I wanted him on the Blackhawks so much. Instead, the blue line has no depth. Kruger is unsigned. Kane may not play.. https://t.co/IchQQ5dPs9
9821	kane	UNKNOWN	I'm starting to think Kane may just be a one season wonder.
9822	kane	UNKNOWN	Ideally all 29 teams would say no and Kane would be launched into the sun, but here we are
9823	kane	UNKNOWN	If I was Walcott, Sterling or Kane sat on the bench, I'd be insulted that Vardy is playing over me. A hard worker, but not international lvl
9824	kane	UNKNOWN	If Saturday was anything to go by, #thfc's issue isnt creating chances but the conversion of those chances. Kane needs support &amp; competition
9825	kane	UNKNOWN	In 4th Form our English teacher made us study Kane and Abel by Jeffrey Archer. Scarred for life. From the shitty writing, not the sex scenes
9826	kane	UNKNOWN	In a way Spurs aren't really getting a 2nd ST if they want the 2nd ST to be like Kane. Son, N'Jie, Pato? don't drop back as well. Maybe Son.
9827	kane	UNKNOWN	Interesting to see where the likes of: Pogba, De Gea, Austin, Kane, Berahino, Benzema, Wanyama, Stones, Borini end up come Wednesday morning
9828	kane	UNKNOWN	It appears that Kane is scheduled to return to WWE on Monday. What he'll be doing, I have no idea. But my gut is... http://t.co/SNykWRxfoQ
9829	kane	UNKNOWN	Join the Kane's (Faculty in Residence) on Friday night for a Baylor Watch Party in the Clubhouse. Kickoff is @ 6:00pm http://t.co/DqA54piIlS
9830	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane and Walcott both come off bench to score on Saturday then get rewarded by......errrrrrr sitting back on the bench #woyproblems #Eng
9831	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane just asked me for the 3rd time if I had fun run
9832	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane may have bitten off more the he can chew
9833	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane may have made it 5-0, I may have lost my bet. But guess what, I can speak properly, Harry Kane can't.
9834	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane may interfere though. I'm calling it. This will not be a clean match. #WWESummerSlam
9835	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane may show up 4 #SummerSlam ..i think Paul Heyman hinted this on #RAW when he said "fetch the devil....and even god himself bla bla""
9836	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane oh no...I sub Kane for lukaku now he scores..... Rooney won't score tomorrow to complete a bad FPL week
9837	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane returns Monday on #Raw will we see the mask or not #WWE http://t.co/UzvqtGdOgs
9838	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane should have scored, but Howard made a great play on that (and the Toby header). Optimistic for the 2nd Half! #COYS
9839	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane to get injured on international duty this weekend, Adebayor to make a miraculous comeback to fire Spurs to 4th #LevyMasterplan
9840	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane wanted to let you all know that Friday is finally here! http://t.co/qTaWPaE4sE
9841	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane will be featured in the ACHiever for the Nov/Dec issue. Photo courtesy @hittphotography  @archildrens http://t.co/HxPM4oN1Ca
9842	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane's confidence is sky high.. Odds on Kaboul to have the game the game of his life Sunday and him to be lost in his pocket?
9843	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane's got United player written all over him for me. See how he does in his 2nd season though. Poor start, but only few games in.
9844	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane: I'm no flash in the pan: Harry Kane can understand why people may say he could be a 'o... http://t.co/kUTRJdREal #soccer #football
9845	kane	UNKNOWN	Listening to the full interview now. Hoping there's some context to the Kane remarks. https://t.co/3mUgEENB1G
9846	kane	UNKNOWN	Lloris, Walker, Alderwiereld, Vertonghen, Davies, Mason, Dier, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Kane tomorrow? Or maybe just unchanged from Stoke
9847	kane	UNKNOWN	MN 99s Business meeting tomorrow at KANE 11am. RSVP to Patti and remember all the construction on 35W and 35E.
9848	kane	UNKNOWN	MONDAY: Roman Reigns goes one on one with the Director of Operations, Kane! http://t.co/mDMus2d0VE
9849	kane	UNKNOWN	Mason behind Kane and Dier in the midfield. More like a pre season line up with everyone getting a game. Season starts on September 13th
9850	kane	UNKNOWN	Mason's 1st, ball going away from goal and Mason has to use his left. Kane's 2nd chance had to pick through 3/4 bodies. Toby's header...
9851	kane	UNKNOWN	May as well strap the golden cockerel from WHL's roof to Kane's back so that the burden on him is at once metaphorical, symbolic &amp; literal
9852	kane	UNKNOWN	Might have to start watching new sports when United announce Kane on Tuesday. That will end my love affair with football.
9853	kane	UNKNOWN	My nightmare for the season with our unbalanced squad is we finish 7th/8th then all our best players (Hugo, Kane, Eriksen etc) want to leave
9854	kane	UNKNOWN	Not sure Archie is to interested in this drab England performance. Kane on 2nd half. Maybe he can play with Rooney http://t.co/nxClns3XAA
9855	kane	UNKNOWN	Not sure why Kane didn't start, he's miles infront of Vardy and also needs more international experience and goals for Tuesday game!!
9856	kane	UNKNOWN	O dear Kane may be going bye bye from the hawks....we will see how this one plays out
9857	kane	UNKNOWN	Oh My God what if they unveil that and it's Kane. This may happen people. (I realize the statue's already been seen, but I know how WWE is)
9858	kane	UNKNOWN	On this day in August 20, 2012~ #RAW: Kane &amp; Zack Ryder vs. Daniel Bryan &amp; The Miz  https://t.co/HxRnZMH4dB
9859	kane	UNKNOWN	One season wonders don't tend to do it in their 1st season when only 21. Ridiculous that ppl even consider it. Kane is class, get used to it
9860	kane	UNKNOWN	Only good thing about getting up at 6 on a Saturday is having an extra 6 hours to ponder on Mr fantasy team, Kane in or out... #dilemma
9861	kane	UNKNOWN	PSA: there's a quiz in aphug tomorrow in Mr. Kane's class!! (On the syllabus???)
9862	kane	UNKNOWN	Play Clinton up front over Kane. He's not on it, still tired imo, give him October off.
9863	kane	UNKNOWN	Pochettino should have started Alli. He'll probably do a Kane and keep him on the bench till November. Might be too late for him this term
9864	kane	UNKNOWN	Practice Today At Kane, Players be there 2:45 make sure everyone's there, review for scrimmage on Saturday !
9865	kane	UNKNOWN	Ramblings were late today,I was falling asleep at the keyboard last night. Kane,Kessel,Philly D, Sens G -  http://t.co/0FtdLGGKt7
9866	kane	UNKNOWN	Rooney off, Kane on. Tickets are still available for Tuesday's game v Switzerland at Wembley, by the way #cunningplan
9867	kane	UNKNOWN	Safety for Kane and the wolves go up 24 to 0 with 257 to go in 1st half over Cameron county. #d9football
9868	kane	UNKNOWN	So Woody has been busy. Rumours he's trying to get two in (Bale and Kane) and two out (De Gea and Evans) by Tuesday. #mufc #motwyw"
9869	kane	UNKNOWN	So if Kane gets a 2nd. Then in the last minute England get a penalty, who takes it? @WayneRooney or @hkane28 ? #ENGvSWI #Rooney #Kane
9870	kane	UNKNOWN	Some of you may have heard of Promo Zo who has been doing mixes for Kane over the last couple of years, mostly... http://t.co/wCHc6lg9dU
9871	kane	UNKNOWN	St. Marys' Michelle Bauer won the girls cross country race vs. Kane and Bradford in 19:21. Amanda Foster of St. Marys was 2nd at 21:10.
9872	kane	UNKNOWN	Stamkos doesn't deserve more $$$ than Toews or Kane...no #Stanley cups...he may get big $$$...but he won't sign with #MapleLeafs...#nocup
9873	kane	UNKNOWN	Surely Spurs are going to sign a striker before 6pm. Kane is currently the only viable option. Sun may deputise but is unknown
9874	kane	UNKNOWN	Tyldesley says we haven't yet heard the name of the striker to beat Rooneys record 10mins after Kane scores his 3rd in 4 matches #EngvSwi
9875	kane	UNKNOWN	Undertaker vs Issac Yankem is the main event. Possibly the 1st Taker vs Kane singles match. #Raw96 #WWENetwork
9876	kane	UNKNOWN	Up front Kawaguchi, Sukuraman, and Kane will be inserted in the line-up tomorrow night
9877	kane	UNKNOWN	We all know Levy really wanted to sell Kane, tomorrow when United bid massive for Hugo he won't be able to resist again
9878	kane	UNKNOWN	Wednesday's Coyotes Tracks - Kane on the Move? http://t.co/MN04NQM7to
9879	kane	UNKNOWN	When @alyssa_tyson wakes me up i think its Saturday aka move out day and she has to ask me to change from my ripped jeans and Kane shirt
9880	kane	UNKNOWN	Who do you reckon will start upfront tomorrow for England? Rooney, Kane or the highest English premier league goal scorer?
9881	kane	UNKNOWN	With Spurs not signing a striker and Kane about to get injured on Saturday palace have an even better chance of making Europe this season
9882	kane	UNKNOWN	Would take Pato all day long as a 3rd striker behind Berahino and Kane for a bench or cup player.
9883	kane	UNKNOWN	You cannot always get what u want. I believe LVG wanted Bale, Ramos and maybe Kane. Lets wait till January https://t.co/G5XvpgA9fU
9884	kane	UNKNOWN	You gonna do an article about this like you have with Kane after 4? @SkyFootball   https://t.co/yQjVvUp5XO
9885	kane	UNKNOWN	You think we have cap issues now; wait until the Oilers trade for Voynov and Kane. https://t.co/wsvs7qZk9Y
9886	kane	UNKNOWN	http://t.co/YjKAvbkM5M twsrc^tfw abc7chicago Doesn't look good for Kane and the Blackhawks
9887	kane	UNKNOWN	6-0. Shelvey stakes a claim, Delph impressive too and Kane back in the goals in some style. Sets Tuesday up very nicely. ML #BO66Y #England
9888	kane	UNKNOWN	@AdamOsper @JustinTHFC84 @timabel6 @Paulhitsheet Levy left us short last season but Kane saved our season. This time you may see us drift.
9889	kane	UNKNOWN	@Allie_Davison  Team Undertaker right here. Thinking we may see Kane tonight though.
9890	kane	UNKNOWN	@AxAs23 Shaw, Sterling, Ox and Kane may have a chance of being top class in the near future
9891	kane	UNKNOWN	@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.
9892	kane	UNKNOWN	@Corrienationstr I agree with you, because Kane is much cheaper and Bale though a fee is agreeable, he may not want to come.
9893	kane	UNKNOWN	@JeffGordonWeb U gotta get in front of Kane he's 1st one a lap down!
9894	kane	UNKNOWN	@KaneAndEriksen @EASPORTSFIFA we adore Kane for being 2nd top scorer ,  he was 2nd top assister
9895	kane	UNKNOWN	@LethalLaserKJ lol jk, Kane is too valuable. Teams would have to give up 1st liners for him. Dude was 2nd in scoring on the team.
9896	kane	UNKNOWN	@PeteSchaad @footysoldiers and he was 4th top scorer in Prem last yr after Kun, Kane and Costa honestly surprised no one signed him #vhappy!
9897	kane	UNKNOWN	@Sirled26 Indeed, hopefully Kane's England success gives his season kick-start it needed. 3 points absolutely vital on Sunday, nothing less.
9898	kane	UNKNOWN	@THNMattLarkin Kane, Karlsson, Getzlaf, Couture available for my 1st pick. Who would you take? I want Forsberg and/or Buff.
9899	kane	UNKNOWN	@TheRomanAnoai you've listened good man your 1st tip is to eliminate all allys to seth rollins... J &amp; J / Kane / Triple H / Steph Mcmahon.
9900	kane	UNKNOWN	@Wonder_Spurs going by the last 3 games yes.I think son may bring last season Kane back.He under to much pressure .We expect to much of him
9901	kane	UNKNOWN	@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all
9902	kane	UNKNOWN	@ahmed_muz No, don't think he's ready yet. With Kane, N'Jie, Son, Chadli &amp; Lamela we have enough options till Jan + Ade in case of emergency
9903	kane	UNKNOWN	@brewingwins "No!" Am I outa the loop somewhere? This is the 2nd time today I've heard Kane &amp; AZ in same breath.
9904	kane	UNKNOWN	@foo fighters going to be a great day at Murrayfield please say happy 21st birthday to Kane that would top off his day
9905	kane	UNKNOWN	@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys
9906	kane	UNKNOWN	@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.
9907	kane	UNKNOWN	@kanechoa Hi, Kane. We're sorry for the inconvenience. May we please have your ticket number and e-mail address via DM? Thank you.
9908	kane	UNKNOWN	@nurfgunjake fingers crossed you see kane tomorrow got to meet up with your boyf
9909	kane	UNKNOWN	@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.
9910	kane	UNKNOWN	@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.
9911	kane	UNKNOWN	A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years
9912	kane	UNKNOWN	Can't wait till 6pm tomorrow to come and the only recognised striker have is Kane for rest of season #TransferWindow #pullyourfingeroutlevy
9913	kane	UNKNOWN	Celebrate the Fall Harvest at the Flickerwood Wine Fest September 26 &amp; 27 in Kane http://t.co/iEh9mU6nc2 #thingstodoinPA #fallharvest
9914	kane	UNKNOWN	GLEN HODDLE: Harry Kane's impact Friday was extraordinary. It was great to see Kane, the leading Premier League scorer, come on and score
9915	kane	UNKNOWN	GOAL! Kane 1-0 England   His 3rd in 4 internationals. Shaw with a great pull back and Kane slams it home with his left.   #ENGvSWI
9916	kane	UNKNOWN	Good finish from Kane, may not rate him that highly but he still scores
9917	kane	UNKNOWN	Great save by Howard thought Kane got his 1st of the season then tho #EFC #COYB
9918	kane	UNKNOWN	Harry Kane may be a noble prince but he can't score goals without his army behind him aka WHY IS KANE ALWAYS ALONE UP FRONT CMON GUYS UGH
9919	kane	UNKNOWN	I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
9920	kane	UNKNOWN	I like what I saw tonight, particularly in the 2nd half. 8 up/8 down. Let's keep rolling lads (hey Roy, you play Kane always) #England
9921	kane	UNKNOWN	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,
9922	kane	UNKNOWN	I think some spurs may just be 0 betraying the abilities of Charlie Austin. We need a different option upfront. Too much like Kane #THFC
9923	kane	UNKNOWN	I'm gonna call out of work tomorrow because Kane turns 1 and it's a big deal #catmom #gotmypictureforinstagramready
9924	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane &amp; Nathaniel  Kanes 1st day at infant school. Nathaniel's final year in juniors school.  #emotional http://t.co/RYsLPj7Qp1
9925	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane finding form at the right time, ready to score twice against Sunderland on Sunday...
9926	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane is going to a jobs fair tomorrow and I just read the first CV he's ever written.  It's awesome!   Is give him a job :-)
9927	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane really missed Eriksen today. Hardly got a sniff. Still did very well in the 2nd half. Definitely needs someone to support him
9928	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane records 2nd assist of the half, as he finds Bishop to give @CabriniMSoccer 3-1 lead over @PSUBWSports with 24 min to play #GoCabrini
9929	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane son Clinton and Lamela as our forward line yea like that going get us top 7 never mind 4th
9930	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane will indeed return this Monday on #RAW. Also, Edge &amp; Christian will be on the #StoneColdPodcast!!!!!
9931	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane with a brilliant finish tonight as England win 2-0 . let's hope he takes his performance into the game on Sunday http://t.co/S6GPyhbC3N
9932	kane	UNKNOWN	Kane's teasing us with this shearer thing. Triple backflip into the corner flag at the stadium of light on Sunday
9933	kane	UNKNOWN	Missed the game, but awesome that Kane scored. Should help a ton for Sunday.  #Confidence
9934	kane	UNKNOWN	My son is walkin out with the ENG team tomorrow night,told him under no circumstances can he b holding hands with Kane,am I right 2 say that
9935	kane	UNKNOWN	Now I'm talking to my big sister and she's telling me that Kane's telling her he is going out on sat and I'm like yhhh I know with me
9936	kane	UNKNOWN	Pat Brisson, the agent for #Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, said Tuesday he believes Kane is innocent of any crime ( Per @ESPNChiPowers)
9937	kane	UNKNOWN	Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.
9938	kane	UNKNOWN	Sunday Supplement are honestly making out that Kane is one of the best strikers in the world.  He isn't even the best striker at Tottenham.
9939	kane	UNKNOWN	True. True. Very true. FALSE.  Go out and get some attacking help before you run Kane into the ground. #COYS  https://t.co/RVZg7rSVNk
9940	kane	UNKNOWN	Wahhh I forgot the 2nd goal was so pretty in the Final. Saad to Richards to Kane. #cryingforever
9941	kane	UNKNOWN	We are passing the ball well but no movement in the final 3rd, Kane was in our own half from defending in that attack!
9942	kane	UNKNOWN	Well done H its good to see you score again. like to see Kane and Son team up Hint Hint! keep going https://t.co/slm8vaprCN

10317	katy perry	UNKNOWN	vinicius vieira silv. @viniciusnasha90 Have you seen these enticing Katy Perry images? You may like: http://t.co/oRYl18HRWe
10318	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@BXHXLD @artschooldrop I'll never forget you getting in an argument over Kendrick's black on black crime stuff in the club on a friday night
10319	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).
10320	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@SmittyGotNoHoes it's the coaching fault how is Kendrick not rushing the passer anymore on 3rd down ? Like Cox not our best option
10321	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@yomilo when we make that restaurant the picture of the ruby yacht beating Kendrick shall hang on the with our 1st dollar
10322	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
10323	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Cole clearly said him and Kendrick aren't doing anything. So whatever he's dropping in February isn't what you think.
10324	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
10325	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
10326	kendrick	UNKNOWN	How cam called obj over to him was just as disrespectful when Kendrick called out Cole 1st and last name on control and not everybody else
10327	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary
10328	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I'm thinking it's either some solo shit or that Kendrick collab  https://t.co/P7y253rFzw
10329	kendrick	UNKNOWN	J. Coles verse in Black Friday was kinda disappointing but Kendrick killed it
10330	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
10331	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick said a whole bunch of nothing on that Black Friday something but you people say e be verse of the moment.
10332	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick the GOAT twitter "All females hoes" twitter  https://t.co/YXd3f1psRg
10333	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick's "u" and The Social Experiment's "Sunday Candy" are two songs that make my allergies act up when I hear them.
10334	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
10335	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Let's be honest how many of ya sat down and listened to Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly? Cause I skimmed through it once and turned it off
10336	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Lmao I thought Kendrick was about to play Black Friday and I freaked out but nah
10337	kendrick	UNKNOWN	My first time hearing "Black Friday" was yesterday.. Kendrick and Cole both murdered it
10338	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Rather have that than the colab with Kendrick.  https://t.co/mcK2fKYxDe
10339	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Someone commented on Black Friday by Kendrick and Cole and wrote, "Once I saw these niggas looking homeless I knew fire was on the way." Lol
10340	kendrick	UNKNOWN	That August Alsina album is dope. Most artists' sophomore album isn't as good as the first (*cough* Kendrick *cough*) but this joint fire
10341	kendrick	UNKNOWN	This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him
10342	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Wale don't do this man. I fux wit you but you 2nd or 3rd tier in this rap game bro. Kendrick is miles in front, he'll answer in time #TDE
10343	kendrick	UNKNOWN	While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
10344	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Why can't Kendrick rap on every song like he did Black Friday. Old Kendrick is better.
10345	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
10346	kendrick	UNKNOWN	if you think Kendrick's Black Friday was better than J. Cole's, you can block me now
10347	kendrick	UNKNOWN	rap mon and suga sampling swimming pools by kendrick is by far the weirdest shit i have seen
10348	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I fucks with Kendrick, but March Madness deserve to be our national anthem it's that cold
10349	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Pink Friday set the standard for all Rap albums. If it wasn't for Nicki y'all wouldn't have them mediocre bitches like Kendrick and Drake.
10350	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@Clammiee I can see that fam... Have you heard Kendrick lamar Black Friday?
10351	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@Co_Leone with him and Kendrick? No only "Black Friday"
10352	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@JColeAustralia keep hearing about cole being support to kendrick here in March, thoughts ?
10353	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@JJArnold34 @aronde365 Kendrick is going to outshine Cole on this collab album tbh. He already did it on Black Friday.
10354	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@Kontemplat3 I heard 2chajnz and Wayne is making one and if Kendrick and Cole's drops in Feb. it'll be game over
10355	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@LuisMParra17 im being dead ass lol Kendrick nominated for 11 grammys most by any artist 2nd is taylor swift and the weeknd
10356	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@LyleMSpencer In one respect, teams may value Zobrist more highly than Kendrick due to the draft pick compensation tied to Kendrick.
10357	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@MrLheureux listen to J Cole - Black Friday , till the very end. He hints it. &amp; Kendrick - Black Friday too.
10358	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@MusicsRebellion Lotta problems with this list... only one I'll mention here is that GKMC is Kendrick's 2nd album
10359	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@OGconstant Ay What Did you think of the Black Friday Tracks From Cole and Kendrick?
10360	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@PhoebeDuffield Hey, just to let you know, we have tickets for Florence &amp; Kendrick with no booking fees: https://t.co/l24BY2KQtA
10361	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@R_Harmon32 @KingTilhas @MOTM96 when haha Ricky come through to the Kendrick concert tomorrow!
10362	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@RicoRMG @Pizar187 @ndrewBailey hell yea. I was really feelin kendrick and coles black friday shit too. I can wait for the album
10363	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@Sebi17__ and then the j cole and Kendrick album is coming out in February
10364	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@ShaquilleHoNeal from what I think you're asking, in no order. Future, Drake, Thug, Cole, Kendrick and Tiller a close 6th
10365	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@TRILLESTCHICO Ay you heard "Black Friday " by Kendrick a J Cole
10366	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@VaartAttack @JColeNC releasing one with Kendrick in Feb
10367	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@_m4verick @dream_chaser_10 seen a photos of them and the caption said "Kendrick and Sherane in the 9th grade" and they were on some bed
10368	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@aleexxis_ @alexisalderetee he's making an album with Kendrick and Drake... it drops sometime in February
10369	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@cavenigger hes got a new mixtape?? Or u mean the small black friday thing with kendrick
10370	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@cheyenethomas2 only the intro? Man you missing out and the only thing weak about J. Coles Black Friday was Kendrick's beat...
10371	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@devtrilla @DailyRapFacts yeah true. I say he drops in Feb. but idk... That's when j cole and Kendrick I think might drop their project...
10372	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@dubKeks @Mr_15_ I get u, but for me, the emotion/anger in Kendrick makes him much more like Tupac. Blacker the berry, Black Friday, U, etc.
10373	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@ekat2104 Run the Jewels and Kendrick took 1 and 2. With Modest Mouse in 3rd. Bit of a genre shift there...
10374	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@esivs i put Kendrick's in 2nd. i think it belongs to cole. it was a better batch of art.
10375	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@inihelene have you heard Black Friday by Kendrick Lamar &amp; j.Cole ??
10376	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@iwmarrujo @MrGonzalezz Kendrick's 1st record is a top 10-15 album ever imo. 2nd album is when keepin it real goes wrong...
10377	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@leahmoloney so with you buy tickets for Saturday to see Flo you'll only see her and Kendrick (I'm not sure but it's what I understood when
10378	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@mccoveychron @gggiants Panik may be easiest one to trade, just b/c that gaping hole is most easily plugged with current FA (Z, Kendrick)
10379	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@mrwavez24 @JeremyLawrencee @Jiroum_Masoudi @goldgoldenexes Kendrick knows Kanye the GOAT, hence The Black Friday freestyle.
10380	kendrick	UNKNOWN	@richierich65 the Kendrick album may be the most overrated album of all time. It's a good album but very little replay value
10381	kendrick	UNKNOWN	After all the X-Mas parties this weekend - Don't forget to visit Kendrick and Sean - Keith this SUNDAY NIGHT at... https://t.co/78hgs9Zpef
10382	kendrick	UNKNOWN	All 3 of Washington's TD's have come at the expense of our Linebackers. 1st Ryans on Reed, 2nd Kendrick's on Reed and 3rd #25 on Alonzo
10383	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Ask me after February 16...we'll see if Coke drops this collab with Kendrick   https://t.co/Ryj3tE6Hph
10384	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Boy I bet Kendrick is glad he didn't go for that 2nd cup of coffee before calling TLR on Greinke. #minutesaway #Dbacks
10385	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Bruh if Kendrick brings out the rest of TDE tomorrow, I'll die on the spot.
10386	kendrick	UNKNOWN	But did you hear the Black Friday tracks from Kendrick and Cole.... Bless baby Jesus sandals..
10387	kendrick	UNKNOWN	But ya...I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album.
10388	kendrick	UNKNOWN	C'mon, Kendrick, C'mon. He shot my heart with those lines.
10389	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Cole dissed Future on his Black Friday, Kendrick dissed everyone on his. the collab album bout to be one big subliminal diss.
10390	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Did we all forget about Kendrick's Black Friday track? Lawwwd
10391	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Do the Black Friday verses from Kendrick and Cole count?  https://t.co/vGdQ9RVCEu
10392	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Em is better at painting a picture with his words.and thats just my opinion..cuz ppl view Kendrick's 1st album as a story..and I don't.
10393	kendrick	UNKNOWN	FACT: if Kendrick made a song about crapping it would be 10x more influential than a Future song about slavery https://t.co/k6WXDJKkSH
10394	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Fab &amp; 50's tapes the only shit I been playing lately.. Well add cole and kendrick's Black Friday too of course
10395	kendrick	UNKNOWN	He's still new to us. If Cole &amp; Kendrick just now getting the attention they deserve...c'mon now. These ppl clueless https://t.co/Gy1Yio44fL
10396	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Hearing Kendrick on "Black Friday" def made me miss the GKMC Kendrick again.
10397	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Honestly to me this really isnt about Kendrick being King. Of course it wll happen in this lameass 2015 https://t.co/3jYrYYQ5xS
10398	kendrick	UNKNOWN	How is J Cole gonna colab with Kendrick and then get made to look like a fool on Black Friday
10399	kendrick	UNKNOWN	How you going to be a Cole account and put up the Kendrick verse...?  https://t.co/ULqIfqwtfL
10400	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/vjMyTjFRnG Fitness Tips with Ashleigh McIvor &amp; Kendrick - December 7, 2015 Squat
10401	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I can't get over Black Friday! J Coke and Kendrick both killed it!  https://t.co/YQWWdC2F5s
10402	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I just started busting out rapping to Kendrick's Black Friday and Sadie almost spit her water out
10403	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I know [Nicki M] was commissioned for the BBHMM remix back in June along w/ Kendrick but i have no idea what progress has been made #ANTI
10404	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I only give Kendrick his props because of his rapping style on Black Friday, his lyrical sense is there as well but it's Cole or die for me
10405	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I stanned Kendrick heavy Dec-Feb should I be happy about this and call everyone favs irrelevant? https://t.co/LB8mZ9F1rn
10406	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I think if Cole wanted he coulda had a better verse on Black Friday than Kendrick
10407	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Is anyone going to go see Kendrick at day for night tomorrow?!?
10408	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Is it February yet? Need the new J. Cole album (with Kendrick?).
10409	kendrick	UNKNOWN	It'll be interesting to know what content Kendrick comes up with for his 3rd album and what it's conceptual conception will be about
10410	kendrick	UNKNOWN	KENDRICK and SEAN - KEITH want to take you to a GAY BAR -  TONIGHT as we fling cocktails - SUNDAY  7 PM-2 AM... https://t.co/gTaA7czMin
10411	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kanye west is dropping a new album and Kendrick and cole are dropping a collab album. The rest of the rap game may as well give up.
10412	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick Murdered it No disrespect J Cole wounded it https://t.co/p04GVP40fE
10413	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick always new content u don't know what to expect... Cole talk the same Shiit from 1st project on every one https://t.co/AgbUNmCxP6
10414	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick did the same except talk about Molly, but he said we can live at the mall.. that's turnt https://t.co/HLCFn6rovb
10415	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick has become a lot more covert with his "wokeness" that most "woke" listeners may have felt comfortable with in his pre-TPAB music...
10416	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick in Black Friday &gt; J Cole in it
10417	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick may have gotten all the critical acclaim... But that album ain't last past the first week from my understanding.
10418	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick sets the bar on that Black Friday shit got damn #TDE
10419	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick's Black Friday goes so fucking hard, and over Cole's beat just makes it better.
10420	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick's Black Friday on replay, gonna be that kind of day.
10421	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly was at 1st (2) (p)IMP (a) (c)ATERPILAR.tupac.the last track on the album ends in a conversation between the 2
10422	kendrick	UNKNOWN	LMAO i read "cultural evolution is Lamarckian" and was like o shit what's that dude's name again? and the 1st thing i thought was Kendrick
10423	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Let August &amp; Kendrick get on the same track &amp; watch the world crack!... Slowly
10424	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday. When he used the same EXACT flows in that.
10425	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Listen Kendrick hard but that last Album was weak af yal can remove yal lips from his dick cause the 1st Album was wayyyyyy harder
10426	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Me after listening to "Black Friday" by Kendrick for the first time https://t.co/h8Iq2uNp5Y
10427	kendrick	UNKNOWN	My microwave wasn't working so I just played Kendrick and Coles Black Friday...
10428	kendrick	UNKNOWN	No disrespect to kendrick but march madness was the song of the year if not the greatest song of all time
10429	kendrick	UNKNOWN	OMG. I don't know why I'm just hearing "Black Friday" but J.Cole murked Kendrick big time.

10433	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Remember when u called plies a monkey? "Or when u agreed Kendrick was the 2nd best rapper in the game but everyone else was the first?"
10434	kendrick	UNKNOWN	So Drake's "If You're Reading..." is the 3rd best album of the year, behind Kendrick and Adele (haha). They might as well hand me the Grammy
10435	kendrick	UNKNOWN	So what do you think about Black Friday by Kendrick
10436	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1. If that happens then it's clearly rigged.
10437	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Someone should suggest she READ some of Kendrick's LYRICS. It may be the 1st socially conscious experience she's EVER had #KathieLee
10438	kendrick	UNKNOWN	They waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
10439	kendrick	UNKNOWN	This kid put Kendrick &amp; J. Cole in his in his top 5 &amp; doesn't know about Section 80 or Friday Night Lights....... Smh at this new generation

10507	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I don't fuck with Kendrick like that at all, but he slayed this: https://t.co/Y8TMOFjrfd
10508	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I enjoy Kendrick for rhymes and performance. That 2nd part makes the first hazy for many, I think.
10509	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I hope these chats about Cole n Kendrick dropping in Feb are true...
10510	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I know y'all band wagoning j Cole and Kendrick if you thought Black Friday was fire

10512	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I laughed at the end of Kendrick's black friday
10513	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I love Kendrick's 2nd album as much as anyone but it doesn't compare to Good Kid Mad City
10514	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I love refinding amazing songs. In 9th grade( now im a junior) i loved SOO many amazing rap songs like Memories back then with Kendrick, bob
10515	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY.
10516	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I posted on FB for the first time in years to only post links from the Black Friday songs from J.Cole and Kendrick lmao

10524	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I'm still not over Black Friday with Kendrick and J Cole tbh
10525	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I'm still not over Kendrick's "Black Friday" freestyle. Lyrically up there with the "Control" verse. I said it.
10526	kendrick	UNKNOWN	I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire.
10527	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Idk how on earth I'm going to get through April 14th without Kendrick and Oscar
10528	kendrick	UNKNOWN	If I could make the Logic and Future shows in March and a Kendrick show, I'd be content.
10529	kendrick	UNKNOWN	If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing
10530	kendrick	UNKNOWN	If you haven't heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J Cole I suggest for you to listen to it.

10557	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Maybe because of this he may compliment Kendrick if they both did a collab album &amp; might fight to hold his own might be good
10558	kendrick	UNKNOWN	Mick Jenkins may be the best rapper alive and this is strong consideration of Kendrick,King Los,Ab-Soul,Big Sean,Vince Staples and others.

12141	murray	UNKNOWN	#MichaelJackson died in the care of Conrad Murray a whole #83Minutes before Murray called 911.The TRUTH coming Thurs  http://t.co/RYdgqKF7no
12142	murray	UNKNOWN	#USOpen Anderson beat Murray in the 4th round. It's Murray's earliest Grand Slam exit in 5 years
12143	murray	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
12144	murray	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
12145	murray	UNKNOWN	@cake_sports Haven't seen it yet. Caught end of Murray loss lights and interview. SVP is that dude though. 1st show.
12146	murray	UNKNOWN	@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke
12147	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson absolutely killed Murray in the 4th set tie break 7-0 to win the match. How embarrassing for Murray
12148	murray	UNKNOWN	Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
12149	murray	UNKNOWN	Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
12150	murray	UNKNOWN	Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen
12151	murray	UNKNOWN	I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
12152	murray	UNKNOWN	If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
12153	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
12154	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
12155	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray been broken in the 3rd. Unreal. Straight sets loss would make my day
12156	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
12157	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated
12158	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. Anderson, magnificent throughout, took 4th set tiebreak 7-0
12159	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
12160	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, "sorry.  sorry."
12161	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!
12162	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!

12164	murray	UNKNOWN	Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.
12165	murray	UNKNOWN	#Aggies punter Kaser chopped down hard. Murray gets the ball back after penalty. 1st-and-10 at ASU's 28.
12166	murray	UNKNOWN	#SNews Shakes: Don't worry we're still in it, Mathoho &amp; Coetzee out, Boks all fit, Honda/McLaren split? Kev v Murray, Isner v Fed 4th Rnd.
12167	murray	UNKNOWN	#USOpen2015 Eeeeek! 3rd set tiebreak for Murray &amp; Anderson! Konta v Kvitova on serve with the Briton serving very well!
12168	murray	UNKNOWN	1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
12169	murray	UNKNOWN	15th seed @kevinanderson18 defeats 20th seed Thiem and he's through to the 4th round of the @usopen to play Bellucci or Murray! #USOpen
12170	murray	UNKNOWN	2nd break point for Murray! Will he take it?
12171	murray	UNKNOWN	3 hours 40 min on the clock now for Murray, but he's still hanging in there - grimly - &amp; has levelled at 2-2 4th set after winning 3rd on TB
12172	murray	UNKNOWN	3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break.
12173	murray	UNKNOWN	5-5 in the 4th set between Murray &amp; Anderson  This one's over the 4hr mark  http://t.co/UNLVTWvp5i #USOpen #bbctennis http://t.co/VvnZ4WEe70

12175	murray	UNKNOWN	@AndrewLightle Murray just got obliterated in the 4th set tiebreak
12176	murray	UNKNOWN	@AnthonyLGargano I'm glad McCoy isn't on the Eagles anymore, he's such a hater. 1st he talked crap about Kelly now talking about Murray.

12178	murray	UNKNOWN	@BehanCFC remember when you said gasquet will be out before Monday? m8 Murray is getting knocked out before him.
12179	murray	UNKNOWN	@CNN headlines are that Murray lose to an UNKNOWN Anderson. The guy is ranked 14th in the world.
12180	murray	UNKNOWN	@EddieHearn @KuganCassius just as hard to get an atmosphere on a Saturday when you have Murray v Falling over Latvian.
12181	murray	UNKNOWN	@Halloweenbby103 how many do you need? I have to get them from mrs murray and we can meet sometime friday
12182	murray	UNKNOWN	@HibernianRetro @Fritz1875 The mic batteries are running out! Murray 3-1 up 2nd set with a break. Matchsticks needed for my eyes here!
12183	murray	UNKNOWN	@John_McEnroe which men's match do you think they will play on the Wednesday night slot?  Federer, Djokovic, or Murray!?
12184	murray	UNKNOWN	@KevinAnderson18 wins the 2nd set v @Andy_Murray to take a two set lead 7-6 6-3   Murray will have to win in 5 sets again if he is to win
12185	murray	UNKNOWN	@Lennyfrigginleo won the game with out Allen in the 4th we would have lost murray had 0 points I do think they needed to settle Allen down
12186	murray	UNKNOWN	@LornaDelRay haha miss you too. And I may have to come to Murray sometime soon and show you guys how to party. Lol
12187	murray	UNKNOWN	@MC_Typo @Garrie24 @EaglesJesse thanksgiving game was a fluke, murray played with a broken hand in 2nd, romo had all day in philly.
12188	murray	UNKNOWN	@MMandryk your cup must runith over with ideas for your column tomorrow Murray!
12189	murray	UNKNOWN	@Michael_Fabiano Help! Should I trade Gore for Murray? I have Gore (I drafted him 4th round) but was offered Murray (went in the 1st round).
12190	murray	UNKNOWN	@MillieMN001 Djokovic has worse antics than Murray in my opinion. But he's my 2nd fav player, after King Roger.
12191	murray	UNKNOWN	@Nef77_NEFL @NEFL_Chiefs See I dont see that really...yeah Murray lost 5 fumbles the 1st 5gms... Didnt have another the next 11
12192	murray	UNKNOWN	@RonanMMurray are you having a sneaky Monday night drink Murray?
12193	murray	UNKNOWN	@SigmundBloom keeping Dez (1st) and Hill (9th). Green&amp;Calvin will prob be the best avail WR's. Nervous about both. Go with Murray or Gore?
12194	murray	UNKNOWN	@TAURUS_FREAK_69 same haha. Yo I had 9th overall pick in a PPR. Went Dez over Julio. Feel like Cowboys have to throw a ton with Murray gone
12195	murray	UNKNOWN	@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3, not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves..important serve game to start?
12196	murray	UNKNOWN	@YaBoiSemaj Anderson won the 4th set in a tiebreaker 7-0 and Murray won the 3rd in a tiebreaker I think 7-3
12197	murray	UNKNOWN	@akacrankster @StaycMaria Murray I think today you gotta take an L and come back stronger tomorrow
12198	murray	UNKNOWN	@darrenrovell They have a very weak evening schedule tonight (Murray &amp; Halep), &amp; Serena in the afternoon tomorrow

12200	murray	UNKNOWN	@gomez_jnr degale for me mate but think Murray would cause him serious problems in the 2nd half of the fight, you?
12201	murray	UNKNOWN	@greglar147 wouldn't be the 1st one dimensional player to ever make top 10. Murray needs to watch out here #breakers
12202	murray	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 2-1 up in the 4th with serve and 2-1 up in sets. Murray jumpy like his had a mustard enema.  #USOpen
12203	murray	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 Murray will take you apart on Monday. One break of serve each set will be enough for Andy. Your return game is shit!
12204	murray	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 breaks with absurdly angled service ret in 1st game of 3rd. Murray's mountain just got higher
12205	murray	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 plays terrific TB &amp; wins it with big off fh winner 7-5. Murray with plenty of work to do now as sun goes down.
12206	murray	UNKNOWN	@krummey I drafted 4th, grabbed Lynch. Murray fell to me in the 2nd round (pretty far with the snake too)
12207	murray	UNKNOWN	@murraycummings @hpsmama Dr. Murray, do you have any openings for tomorrow morning? #drmurray Need help...

12209	murray	UNKNOWN	@nflnetwork @HeathEvans44 I think that Heath needs to put down the crack pipe! It's like saying "Cowboys 3rd best in East without Murray."
12210	murray	UNKNOWN	@ruzkin @redscribe I'm away at Write Around the Murray this weekend, but free next Monday (14th) and the Thursday after that.
12211	murray	UNKNOWN	@skhanjr Sumlin just mixing it up or is Murray the 2nd half an?
12212	murray	UNKNOWN	@theoverrule @AmyFetherolf Murray admitted he took a break for pep talk. I'm not speculating. http://t.co/xcvq8kSWNa
12213	murray	UNKNOWN	@usopen What's with all the day matches tomorrow on Ashe?? No Murray or Halep? Can I change my tix? #usopen
12214	murray	UNKNOWN	ANDERSON versus MURRAY:  Anderson 1 set ahead, now 2nd set. 3games ahead. 76 31 Murray just kept his game.
12215	murray	UNKNOWN	After Kevin Anderson to Murray in the 4th set, it's Roger Federer who dishes out a tiebreak bagel to Isner. 1st set RF, 7-6(0).
12216	murray	UNKNOWN	Although it's hard to tell, since I only have radio commentary. May just be that Anderson is choking badly, not Murray playing better.
12217	murray	UNKNOWN	And ASU tackles Murray short of the 1st down for the first time
12218	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson gets tight but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson saves break points to hold &amp; takes the 2nd set 6-3!! #USOpen
12219	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson is up 2 sets, but Murray is up a break in the 3rd set. It feels even-steven right now.
12220	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson now has the confidence to take rips at the Murray 2nd serve. Time to take off a few mph and up the first serve percentage Andrew
12221	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson survives a test, and now has 2 sets up on Murray. Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback?
12222	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson upsets #3 seed Murray 7-6 6-3 6-7 7-6. Reaches 1st ever major QF. South African played well going for it. Longest match at #USOpen
12223	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson with his 5th set point... And this time, he takes it. Murray will have to come from 2 sets down again. #USOpen2015 #Murray
12224	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen
12225	murray	UNKNOWN	Another dramatic day at the #USOpen. Federer &amp; Murray march on but Bouchard suffers freak fall http://t.co/91bTp3QgXe http://t.co/Wl3Sbfm3LR
12226	murray	UNKNOWN	Back out on practice court -Kevin Anderson after his 4 hr18 min win over Murray to make 1st slam QF @SkySportsTennis http://t.co/VdBePMBzld
12227	murray	UNKNOWN	But I still remember it to this day and it carries much more weight now so S/o to Mr. Murray wherever he may be
12228	murray	UNKNOWN	But it's not just about overall nmbrs. Murray &amp;Mathews will put #Eagles in a lot of 3rd and manageable situations.  And finish at goal line
12229	murray	UNKNOWN	Camera closes in on Murray in his chair after losing 2nd set and he's dropping F bombs like they're going out of fashion. Brilliant. #USOpen
12230	murray	UNKNOWN	Come on, Murray!! Anderson hitting the ball like there's no tomorrow
12231	murray	UNKNOWN	Could the #Aggies get more conservative on offense? Would be hard. Turn it over on 4th-and-1 at ASU's 20, misusing Murray for second time.
12232	murray	UNKNOWN	Dammit, Murray just wont lie down. 4th set tie break now. @kevinanderson18 up 2-1 in sets
12233	murray	UNKNOWN	Dear Twitterverse, may I please have a gif of Murray's F-bombs into the ESPN camera? I need it for future Mondays. Pls and thanks.
12234	murray	UNKNOWN	Did you know that 'Murray' was Trending Topic on Tuesday 8 for 4 hours in Edinburgh? http://t.co/wY3k6hCQmy #trndnl
12235	murray	UNKNOWN	ESPN announces "We're going to be here for awhile tonight" -- Murray looks to run away with the 3rd set. up 3-1, with the serve.
12236	murray	UNKNOWN	FFS fell asleep with an open position on Murray during the 4th set.
12237	murray	UNKNOWN	Few games gone with serve. Murray now leads 5-4 in 3rd set. Anderson will now serve to stay in the set #USOpen
12238	murray	UNKNOWN	Finally, on the 5th attempt, Anderson wins the second set 6-3, serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray.
12239	murray	UNKNOWN	Fine margins in tennis. I think if Murray had won that 1st set tie-break, he'd be preparing for the q/f. Disappointing end to slam season.
12240	murray	UNKNOWN	Game stretched over 2hrs,Murray breaks for the 1st time in the 3rd set,6-5,to serve for match point.....#USOpenWorld

12246	murray	UNKNOWN	Holy shit Murray &amp; Anderson have been battling for 4+ hours on Grandstand. Only the 4th set. #USOpen
12247	murray	UNKNOWN	How to watch Federer and Murray on Monday at the 2015 US Open: Roger Federer will look to punch his ticket to ... http://t.co/qLiTylyRfK
12248	murray	UNKNOWN	I counted five tight points from Anderson in that game, may have been more. Gets a slice of fortune with Murray netting the BH. Holds for 41
12249	murray	UNKNOWN	I fancy Anderson to eventually run out of puff if Murray can take the 3rd set. Big IF.
12250	murray	UNKNOWN	I like that Bellucci is making Murray work for it in this 3rd set! #usopen @usopen @ESPNTennis
12251	murray	UNKNOWN	I'll have a lot more to say on Murray in a #USOpen wrap-up come next Monday, but for now, it's Kevin Anderson's moment in the sun.
12252	murray	UNKNOWN	I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
12253	murray	UNKNOWN	I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match.
12254	murray	UNKNOWN	INTERCEPTION. Simone picks off Murray. ASU 1st and 10 from the 12 yard line.
12255	murray	UNKNOWN	If Murray had won third set convincingly lets say 6-1/6-2/6-3. He would have gone on to win the 4th set.
12256	murray	UNKNOWN	It just wasn't going to be Murray's tournament. A head cold, 2 very tricky 1st and 2nd round opponents and an inspired Anderson performance
12257	murray	UNKNOWN	It may just be me focusing on the losses, but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head, in big games at least.
12258	murray	UNKNOWN	Just started watching this Murray match 3rd set 3-4 and all jmac is talking about is Rafa/ fog WTF!!!
12259	murray	UNKNOWN	Just watched the 4th set breaker; Murray was pumped going into it... to lose it 7-0 is just incredible. #USOpen
12260	murray	UNKNOWN	Konta has started well, at least on her own serve. Murray has a big moment at 4-4 in the 3rd, down 2 sets. #USOpen
12261	murray	UNKNOWN	Kyle Allen making it happen. The injury to Murray may have been a blessing in disguise. Aggies back up 10.
12262	murray	UNKNOWN	Looks like Murray is gonna have to do it the hard way again! 1 set down, 3-1 in the 2nd set! #ustennisopen
12263	murray	UNKNOWN	Lovely overhead (coronal) #auroraborealis seen the night of September 6 at Fairbanks Alaska by M. Murray! http://t.co/ZliVjYjhHF
12264	murray	UNKNOWN	Maybe Sunday was just a funny day for tennis, Murray on getting over a cold: "My voice feels like normal again. Still dull, obviously."
12265	murray	UNKNOWN	Microphone picking up Murray's F bomb at the sit down after the 2nd set...
12266	murray	UNKNOWN	Might as well get the Djokovic vs Federer final on Sunday going, even if Murray was still in the field. Just seems destined for that.
12267	murray	UNKNOWN	Monday #SEC Takeaway: Kyler Murray is electric, but #Aggies need to stick w/ Kyle Allen. Too one dimensional with Murray at QB right now.
12268	murray	UNKNOWN	Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of

12278	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray down 0-30 but strings four in a row to stay alive. Up 6-5.  Can break here to win the set and serve first again in the 2nd...
12279	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray down a set and losing 5-2 in the 2nd set to the 6'8 Anderson. Hard to beat the big hitters when they're serving at their best.
12280	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray get his 1st break of the match to stay in this 2nd set 2-5. Can the No.3 seed continue to turn things around? #USOpen #ESPNTennis
12281	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray gets a warning for racquet abuse then proceeds to give his racquet to someone in the crowd. Anderson breaks back for *2-3 in the 3rd.
12282	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray gets the pass across. 1st and 10 from the 44.
12283	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray gives it his all but can't break Bellucci &amp; now he must hold at 4-5. Can he avoid a 4th set? http://t.co/u1QZis363L
12284	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray gives something else for ASU D to think about.... This may help Allen as well....
12285	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray going for more swear words than south park the movie! C'mon Andy you can turn this around! #usopen #passion
12286	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray holds to 30 and now Anderson leads 5-3 in the 2nd set. Anderson will serve for the set for a 2nd time #USOpen
12287	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray is 28 and at his peak. Not sure he can win another major. He may have to be content with his Wimbledon &amp; US Open wins. #murray
12288	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray is pissed here and in the march! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
12289	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray is so flat atm, if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match.
12290	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray just lost 2nd set and camera stayed on him during changeover. I counted 11 f-words in 20 seconds. New record?
12291	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray loses the 1st point. Anderson playing courageous tennis from the baseline. 27 Winners to Murray's 12 #USOpen Can he keep it up ??
12292	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray needs to send for Thunderbird One here.  Two sets down for the 2nd time.  Surely he can't do it again, can he?  #usopen2015 #murray
12293	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray now down a set a 2 breaks in the 2nd set: Anderson up 6-4, 5-1 #USOpen2015

12297	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray saves 2 break points and manages to hold serve to level the 4th set at 2-2. Murray not going down without a fight #USOpen

12307	murray	UNKNOWN	Not getting a good run with frees for, another goal to Murray from a free kick 16 points up midway through 2nd
12308	murray	UNKNOWN	Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
12309	murray	UNKNOWN	Not the easiest of shots, but Murray may end up really regretting hitting it long to fall down 0-2 in the 2nd set.
12310	murray	UNKNOWN	PRESS: "R U worried Murray dominated his 3rd round?" DJOKER &amp; ROGER: "Only if he dominated ALL his matches like we did." #USOpen2015 #tennis
12311	murray	UNKNOWN	Reminder: Go and see Ms. Murray first thing tomorrow morning in F206 if you still want to sign up for an interview!
12312	murray	UNKNOWN	Since Stan 1st grandslam, he's lost all 4 matches against Murray #USOpen Surely going to be a great match up for Stan !!
12313	murray	UNKNOWN	Start of the 3rd and Murray continues to race through his service games. Bellucci not looking as dangerous as he was in the 1st set #USOpen
12314	murray	UNKNOWN	Tennis US open: Nishikori loses in the 1st round,Dimitrov in the 2nd,Nadal in the 3rd,Murray in the 4th.Who will exit in QF?Let us wait &amp;see

12317	murray	UNKNOWN	Tra Carson gets two carries and gets very little, so it's now 3rd and 7 for Murray and the Aggies.

12326	murray	UNKNOWN	i dont know if this match is live btwn Anderson&amp;Murray, but Murray take the 3rd set...he's kinda frustrated but still...Go Andy!!! #USOpen
12327	murray	UNKNOWN	murray break back anderson wud be stupid sha 2 allow a double break I expect it 2 get 2 5-3 and he serves out the 2nd set leaving it at 6-3
12328	murray	UNKNOWN	pondering which wine to open for the 3rd set, @kevinanderson18 2-0 up against Murray #USOpen #stellenbosch GO KEVIN!!
12329	murray	UNKNOWN	15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
12330	murray	UNKNOWN	4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
12331	murray	UNKNOWN	@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
12332	murray	UNKNOWN	@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
12333	murray	UNKNOWN	@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
12334	murray	UNKNOWN	@GolfYeezus @S1NGH7 yeah Murray 1st/2nd, sproles for the 3rd down td lol
12335	murray	UNKNOWN	@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
12336	murray	UNKNOWN	@JoshCollacchi to be honest, I'd let Murray run it every time, even on 4th and 35, than let Trey throw.
12337	murray	UNKNOWN	@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray.
12338	murray	UNKNOWN	@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
12339	murray	UNKNOWN	@Linda_Grace74 I can't see the tennis either, gutted I never sat the football but it looks like it's sky again for Murray?
12340	murray	UNKNOWN	@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
12341	murray	UNKNOWN	@ScottSFTC I wish I had seen your picks earlier after the day I had!!! Murray won 3-0 so your 2nd pick didn't hit. GL
12342	murray	UNKNOWN	@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure.
12343	murray	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
12344	murray	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis the later i stay up the better...c'mon Murray!
12345	murray	UNKNOWN	@andy_murray wins 3rd set to get back into the match but @kevinanderson18 still leads 6-7 3-6 7-6 Murray has won 8 times from 2 sets down.
12346	murray	UNKNOWN	@kevinanderson18 you're serving big tonight, you'll play Murray on Monday and you'll struggle to get your first serves in play.
12347	murray	UNKNOWN	@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
12348	murray	UNKNOWN	@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
12349	murray	UNKNOWN	@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray
12350	murray	UNKNOWN	@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift
12351	murray	UNKNOWN	A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
12352	murray	UNKNOWN	A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
12353	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game. #WellPlayed. http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs
12354	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson stopped at the donation station. Murray on way back from 2 sets down!! C'mon Andy!
12355	murray	UNKNOWN	Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
12356	murray	UNKNOWN	Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
12357	murray	UNKNOWN	Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
12358	murray	UNKNOWN	Best of luck @kevinanderson18 on 4th rd @usopen vs Murray! Wish I was there to cheer you on. Go Illini!
12359	murray	UNKNOWN	Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.
12360	murray	UNKNOWN	But! Murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got GAME ON! http://t.co/tzKVTmQMkL
12361	murray	UNKNOWN	Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.
12362	murray	UNKNOWN	Christine Michael is probably the 6th best RB in the division behind Murray, Mathews, Sproles, Morris, and Mostert.
12363	murray	UNKNOWN	Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
12364	murray	UNKNOWN	Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
12365	murray	UNKNOWN	Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome.
12366	murray	UNKNOWN	Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015
12367	murray	UNKNOWN	Good straight sets win for Murray last night hope he kicks on from here and good chance of winning the #USOpen for a 2nd time
12368	murray	UNKNOWN	Got Murray at 7. Surprised but my cousin took Antonio Brown at #2. Rodgers fell to me in the 2nd. Stashed Foster away in the 7th. Love it.
12369	murray	UNKNOWN	Great Sunday Sesh at Redcliffe on the Murray today!! Beautiful weather for it. It was also Wilsons first gig to... http://t.co/a7aWtpHQsl

12371	murray	UNKNOWN	Happy Labor Day @ChadMMurray and @sarahroemer. Hope you enjoy baby Murray's 1st Labor day. Much Love to yall and baby Murray
12372	murray	UNKNOWN	I can't believe Murray has to play on the junior varsity court in the 4th round of the U.S. Open
12373	murray	UNKNOWN	If this goes all the way to the 5th.... Odds lie with Murray to take the match. #usopen #SSTennis
12374	murray	UNKNOWN	It may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! Don't tell that Anderson and Murray! Incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. #USOpen2015
12375	murray	UNKNOWN	Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen
12376	murray	UNKNOWN	Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at. Still, Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set.
12377	murray	UNKNOWN	Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
12378	murray	UNKNOWN	Morning from #Woking where it is a dull start but hoping for sun to break through later. Couldn't stay up for end of Murray's match. :(
12379	murray	UNKNOWN	Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
12380	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass.
12381	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray breaks again!! Back to back breaks in the 3rd set, Game face on!
12382	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray d. Bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. Much better play from the start compared to his last match. Very tamed match. Into 4th round. #USOpen
12383	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
12384	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
12385	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray has decided to only hit Aces. Already 4 and it's just his 2nd game !!
12386	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
12387	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray is outshooting St. Mary 6-4 in the 21st minute, but still no score.
12388	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray must must must win this game on Anderson serve to turn the tide and give him something for the 3rd to build on #USOpen
12389	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen
12390	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week.......
12391	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray seals the 2nd set 6-2 #USOpen2015 #USOpen #easy
12392	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
12393	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
12394	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray takes the 3rd set, game on!
12395	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray will get to watch the second half of Scotland v Germany. Get him pumped for his own battle.  https://t.co/0tpTX3V6uM
12396	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
12397	murray	UNKNOWN	Murray's form has been tremendous this year ... a win tonight would've seen him reach 60 victories in a season for just the 2nd time

12403	murray	UNKNOWN	So in order for #Raiders to beat the #Bengals Derek Carr has to have a perfect game, He needs to RUN for 1st downs. Murray needs to shine
12404	murray	UNKNOWN	Staying up 2 watch the Anderson v Murray match was so worth it. Only missed some of the 4th set when my eyes couldn't anymore!
12405	murray	UNKNOWN	Sumlin says he put Kyler Murray in for Kyle Allen during 1st half as a "change of pace quarterback." That pace: Fast. Murray has some wheels
12406	murray	UNKNOWN	Superb from Anderson. Good fight from Murray as always. 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo.

12414	murray	UNKNOWN	With an ace, Murray takes the 3rd set 7-6(2)  but still trails Anderson 1-2.
12415	murray	UNKNOWN	Wow!! Just waking up to this. Saw it up to 2-1 Murray in 3rd set. Anderson was unbelievable; incredible win. https://t.co/Txqzz5PUrr

12417	murray	UNKNOWN	you don't usually get a tough opponent till week 2, Murray's had 3 in the 1st week. Whoever heard of having to play 7 top 40 players to win
12418	murray	UNKNOWN	@andy_murray knows how to wring my nerves! Talk about tension and it's only the 1st set :-) Brilliant stuff. Behind you all the way Murray!

13584	niall	UNKNOWN	niall's voice is just TOO GOOD this 5th album will kill me
13585	nicki	UNKNOWN	@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
13586	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom.
13587	nicki	UNKNOWN	@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
13588	nicki	UNKNOWN	@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show
13589	nicki	UNKNOWN	@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent
13590	nicki	UNKNOWN	@nice_feminist she may be a """"problematic fave"""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit
13591	nicki	UNKNOWN	@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
13592	nicki	UNKNOWN	@spectralpixie nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao  Nicki copies off Kim's OLD shit, Kim was the first female with --
13593	nicki	UNKNOWN	A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf
13594	nicki	UNKNOWN	A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
13595	nicki	UNKNOWN	All Nicki said was "what's good" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok
13596	nicki	UNKNOWN	And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as "a raging angry black women" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for
13597	nicki	UNKNOWN	Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
13598	nicki	UNKNOWN	I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's
13599	nicki	UNKNOWN	I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
13600	nicki	UNKNOWN	If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down.
13601	nicki	UNKNOWN	If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
13602	nicki	UNKNOWN	Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
13603	nicki	UNKNOWN	Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki
13604	nicki	UNKNOWN	Lost some respect for Nicki after that. You may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage #VMAs
13605	nicki	UNKNOWN	Miley has no tits &amp; ass but Kim and Nicki may have the same botox injection expert and Kim ain't got shit to lose. https://t.co/EEjrWcrHzw
13606	nicki	UNKNOWN	Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley
13607	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki dead ass sat in our fAces and lied to us about meek. bye http://t.co/XTK1x0URvo
13608	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
13609	nicki	UNKNOWN	So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin
13610	nicki	UNKNOWN	This ain't the 1st day I've ever called Nicki ignorant, fuck. I'm on and off w/ her. Its simple, &amp; I don't always like how she handle shit.
13611	nicki	UNKNOWN	Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
13612	nicki	UNKNOWN	Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
13613	nicki	UNKNOWN	i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
13614	nicki	UNKNOWN	i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T "SKINNY AND WHITE"+
13615	nicki	UNKNOWN	miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
13616	nicki	UNKNOWN	tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after Nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
13617	nicki	UNKNOWN	(Nicki chuckled.) So, you just got here in Sun City? https://t.co/AIrLJlok7G
13618	nicki	UNKNOWN	*sends bae video of drake looking at nicki like she the sun* why u dont look at me like that
13619	nicki	UNKNOWN	1. Drake  2,3,4 is Sean, Kendrick, Cole whatever u want the order to be   5. no idea who in that 5th spot...Nicki? I'll leave that to y'all
13620	nicki	UNKNOWN	1st of all...why didn't Meek help Nicki to the stage. I would have cussed him to filth
13621	nicki	UNKNOWN	1st time I've watched the vmas in years .. What, did Nicki just....
13622	nicki	UNKNOWN	1st: Taylor and Avril 2nd: Taylor and Nicki 3rd: Taylor and Katy????  Hahahaahhahahhh.. maybe its the start of the new beginning???
13623	nicki	UNKNOWN	2nd one is a trinidadian headdress i believe, which is nicki's home country. im silent on the other 3 tho https://t.co/0udsnLtBeC
13624	nicki	UNKNOWN	5SOS won, Taylor &amp; Nicki had a duet, Nicki looked like she wanted to beat the crap out of Miley. Waking up to this, Monday is good for once!
13625	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Ashley_Chenelle is she cussing out Nicki? I may need to learn how to work this tv
13626	nicki	UNKNOWN	@BaconBitsBitch lol.. I agree w Nicki and Sammy 1st and second Miley might be doing good deeds OK but she's literally a fucking mess. So shh
13627	nicki	UNKNOWN	@DaRealAmberRose hey amber are you free November 14th. I asked Nicki but her best friend told me she has a boyfriend, that's clear.
13628	nicki	UNKNOWN	@DaRealKhefner: When Nicki see Miley Sunday: https://t.co/NF2F3AFZOF   the accuracy
13629	nicki	UNKNOWN	@ERINJEEN you may dress like nicki and amelia may dress like miley
13630	nicki	UNKNOWN	@GrilledCamwich you're missing the whole point onto what Nicki was trying to say. it may be mtv wasn't racist, but many times
13631	nicki	UNKNOWN	@HighOnVibe Depends what she said though, Nicki may have had a reason to start! Have you seen the video?
13632	nicki	UNKNOWN	@HipHopWired LMAO Nicki can never fuck with Kim. Kim's Black Friday diss record lyrically slaughtered Nicki. What are u talkin bout???
13633	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Just_Kendall @MoneyTalker_K @Drake Nicki wrote everything drake a emotion soft ass nigga crying cause he wasn't 1st in line my dad meek won
13634	nicki	UNKNOWN	@LeilaJoldusic Lmaooo but the Nicki controversy may get people talking
13635	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Minajlb @SOFTXSHUG but Nicki dissed her first n threw the 1st shots all d while copying her
13636	nicki	UNKNOWN	@NICKIMINAJ sat here and rewatched Nicki's opening and that is all for tonight
13637	nicki	UNKNOWN	@NicoletteKelley Set a reminder: October 6. Get ready to join the celebration around #AllDayBreakfast, Nicki!
13638	nicki	UNKNOWN	@OnikaThot Nicki was trying to or the producers told her to discredit Mariah there and Mariah sat her bc she's still more successful
13639	nicki	UNKNOWN	@SarahSahadinCBB You can always meet them on the Friday shakedown as Nicki said that'd be better, so it probably will be for the others! ;)
13640	nicki	UNKNOWN	@TMZLive @MTVNews Miley &amp; Nicki staged it. Not only did NM break a smile, from the 2nd c-angle Miley says "what", before Nicki states topic
13641	nicki	UNKNOWN	@ayahmdee13 I think her and Nicki opened the show. But never got to watch it. And, I think I may have been watching the backstage haha
13642	nicki	UNKNOWN	@bieberloundon i feel like Nicki may have been joking but miley may not have known. Nicki is so vocal on twitter i feel like she
13643	nicki	UNKNOWN	@dquintia_ Nicki's role may be essential, but it is not a role to defend publicly. Do you get what I mean?
13644	nicki	UNKNOWN	@eh_kees perception is 9/10th of reality. Because we perceive Meek as "not good enough" for Nicki. His support looks like he is star struck
13645	nicki	UNKNOWN	@garcia_syanne are you going over auntie nicki's tomorrow?
13646	nicki	UNKNOWN	@gatheringcopal Lol It just seems like Nicki like to really take things to the 3rd nipple. Miley, Mariah, Kim, Taylor, list goes on
13647	nicki	UNKNOWN	@highsociety_k @teamkimlisa account to Kims MOTHER Kim was born 1976 she turned 39 July 11. Nicki will be 33 in 4 months. My accuracy &gt; urs
13648	nicki	UNKNOWN	@leslimorale5 That's like saying Kim never actually said Nicki's name in Black Friday. You know who was the target.
13649	nicki	UNKNOWN	@naidej_ I'll tell you more tomorrow but Miley was throwing shade at Nicki and Nicki just called her out
13650	nicki	UNKNOWN	@nycki96 @tigrayrocks WE aren't too far apart, Nicki. In fact, we may be at the same point. I don't remember if I stopped at 11 or 12.
13651	nicki	UNKNOWN	@vertivangogh I may watch them just to see why people are saying Nicki called out Miley lol. That was probably deserved.
13652	nicki	UNKNOWN	@zackrorz but people hated way before then tbh and I think it may have been directed at lil' Kim other than Iggy because Nicki denied later
13653	nicki	UNKNOWN	All he said is that it was funny, and weren't you up Nicki's ass in July? https://t.co/MnZZR01bDP
13654	nicki	UNKNOWN	All the talk will be about Nicki and Miley tomorrow. Nothing else has been talk worthy. #VMAs
13655	nicki	UNKNOWN	Alone at a McDonald's. Few vestibules away people are talking about Mar's presidency run while the other table talks about Nicki's VMA feud.
13656	nicki	UNKNOWN	And that Nicki and Miley "beef" looked toooo staged, Nicki smiled, Miley response was too instant (like she been practisin it).. c'mon MTV
13657	nicki	UNKNOWN	Ask a kid watching the #VMAs where they were when Nicki called Miley out...now ask them what happen Nov 22 1963 (crickets). #SoSad
13658	nicki	UNKNOWN	Azealia Banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the Miley Cyrus and Nicki... http://t.co/BUZ6UjCoCD
13659	nicki	UNKNOWN	Basically my Sunday-Monday transition   "@en_jajaja: Nicki: thank you to my pastor Nicki: SO BITCH YOU WAS TALKIN MAD SHIT WHAT UP W THAT"
13660	nicki	UNKNOWN	Be prepared to listen about Nicki and Miley tomorrow at school, or maybe Kanye
13661	nicki	UNKNOWN	Because Nicki actually looked up to Kim but Kim came at her for no reason?? Why argue with someone you idolized? https://t.co/LjIu2xxZiL
13662	nicki	UNKNOWN	Bet when Nicki sat down next to meek she said "now thats how you handle a beef nigga" #VMAs #NickiMinaj
13663	nicki	UNKNOWN	Boohoo Miley called Nicki unpolite KIM CALLED HER EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN just admit NICKI KNOW WHO TO TRY
13664	nicki	UNKNOWN	Boy...Kenryn just asked me if Nicki goin march in a second line...lmaoo
13665	nicki	UNKNOWN	But Miley, what IS good? I think Nicki needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp.
13666	nicki	UNKNOWN	Can't wait to see the lame ass "think pieces" about how Nicki is "an angry black woman" and how she was "mean" to Miley tomorrow
13667	nicki	UNKNOWN	Damn.... Miley Cyrus needs to watch it that bitch is gonna get sat on and crushed by Nicki.
13668	nicki	UNKNOWN	Don't act like Azealia won't jank Nicki in her shit. She may be a skinny but she got them four weights.
13669	nicki	UNKNOWN	Hi my name iSSk Nicki and itsSSKS tHFfe firSSKT day of sShckhool - me in my new retainer tomorrow
13670	nicki	UNKNOWN	I can't lie that "Black Friday" my baby Nicki took an L, fuck Kim she been ran thru more than McDonalds drivethru  https://t.co/o2gL0EijAb
13671	nicki	UNKNOWN	I do have some complaints about this this beautiful Sunday night. First, miley handled that well. Nicki should be... http://t.co/4pAjjyTGhd
13672	nicki	UNKNOWN	I don't get too riled up, because Nicki may be dancing with Miley onstage at the next awards show. #VMAs
13673	nicki	UNKNOWN	I don't think Nicki's pregnant. Stomach was flat again in the side view. Think she was just sticking her butt out in the 1st pic.
13674	nicki	UNKNOWN	I feel like I'm in 3rd grade again watching the VMAs.   Kanye is to Trump as Nicki is to Miley.
13675	nicki	UNKNOWN	I feel like she's trying to do a Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded thing like Nicki but it's literally just Flaming Lips album rejects.
13676	nicki	UNKNOWN	I get that marriage equality probably isn't an issue that directly affects Nicki so she may focus on it less...
13677	nicki	UNKNOWN	I just realized today is Sunday y'all Nicki and Kanye were preachin to the choir
13678	nicki	UNKNOWN	I like Meek Mills when he raps because he talks like a handicapped 4th grader...how do he and Nicki hold conversations???
13679	nicki	UNKNOWN	I like to avoid my Monday's like Miley avoided Nicki at the VMAs
13680	nicki	UNKNOWN	I may even include a rendition of Nicki's 'death stare' she shot at Miley last night
13681	nicki	UNKNOWN	I may joke, but Nicki's totally valid points about a racist system will be forgotten again because of a white woman's comments
13682	nicki	UNKNOWN	I remember when haterade by Nicki pharrell and Gucci was my ringtone in the 4th grade
13683	nicki	UNKNOWN	I start school tomorrow and I'm here watching Kanye rant, Miley and Nicki go at it and Tori Kelly blow the roof out of the #VMAs
13684	nicki	UNKNOWN	I still think they should have let Nicki continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt Miley's feelings
13685	nicki	UNKNOWN	I still would like a Nicki follow, but if she followed me, she'd just be a flop that followed me.  https://t.co/DhxDzeUZog
13686	nicki	UNKNOWN	I think sure Nicki may have been joking though, if she had real beef I feel like it would be a lil scarier.
13687	nicki	UNKNOWN	I thought this may have been entertaining after nicki's moment but it's actually very painful
13688	nicki	UNKNOWN	I was just stalking Nicki's IG and now I have to work out for 18 hours tomorrow
13689	nicki	UNKNOWN	I wish Nicki would have flew across the stage and slapped that hoe !  https://t.co/D9dtRKeZji
13690	nicki	UNKNOWN	I wonder if they'll cut out Nicki calling Miley out when they air it again tomorrow
13691	nicki	UNKNOWN	I'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki. Taylor started the pop star against pop star war, nicki didn't even sat her name
13692	nicki	UNKNOWN	I'm at work for 14.5 hours tomorrow lmao someone make me go to bed and stop reading articles about nicki
13693	nicki	UNKNOWN	I'm literally nervous for what Kanye may say tonight...he more of a loose cannon than Nicki
13694	nicki	UNKNOWN	If I rise tomorrow and there's no sign of 1) Zayn throwing a public tantrum or 2) Nicki taking over the world then I'm checking out of life
13695	nicki	UNKNOWN	If the weeknd doesn't clear up the rumors about him disliking black women tomorrow I might have to pull a kayne on him then pull a Nicki
13696	nicki	UNKNOWN	It looks like Nicki may be very small in person. Well small with a big butt lol.
13697	nicki	UNKNOWN	It's Monday and I just need to know the status of this Nicki and Miley beef...
13698	nicki	UNKNOWN	Just watched how Nicki called out bitch Miley Cyrus on stage at the #VMAs. May the one who has the biggest ass wins.
13699	nicki	UNKNOWN	K. I'm just already done with everyone. I don't think I'll be talking to anyone tomorrow. I'm so close to havin my own Nicki moment...
13700	nicki	UNKNOWN	Like Miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought Nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure. Her words.
13701	nicki	UNKNOWN	Lol watch how the media paints Nicki as an angry black woman tomorrow morning and miley as the victim #bye
13702	nicki	UNKNOWN	Lol. You can still watch, Nicki asked Miley what's good and called her a bitch (most interesting part of the show) https://t.co/tCIdK88LtI
13703	nicki	UNKNOWN	Meek Mill dissed Future too? Nicki may as well start giving him an allowance cause it's all over.
13704	nicki	UNKNOWN	Meek about to have a 2nd wave coming from twitter bc Nicki came harder without a song haha
13705	nicki	UNKNOWN	Miley better pick up the Hannah Montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from Nicki. #VMAs2015
13706	nicki	UNKNOWN	Miley was a child actor.I'm sure most of the net worth is from the Hannah Montana days.C'mon now. Don't play Nicki.  https://t.co/ovhZyCwYOy
13707	nicki	UNKNOWN	More like Taylor wants to stay the hell away from Miley bc she saw how Nicki dragged her Sunday. https://t.co/Xo7KkQWeSS
13708	nicki	UNKNOWN	NYFW doesn't begin until Thursday. Y'all gonna get Nicki inadvertently cursed out cz mfs gonna think she stayed home.
13709	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki &amp; Tay may be friends but I'm still not a fan like was Nicki for real about Miley this is too much for my emotions Im so confused #VMAs
13710	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki Minaj Confronts Miley Cyrus Live on Stage at the VMA's. Sunday night Nicki called Miley out in a way that... http://t.co/NJ6dJO7HZ8
13711	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki and Miley left nothing to the imagination at Sunday night's VMA's.
13712	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki carried Taylor so much in that performance, tomorrow she's going to need a Nicki massage. #VMAs
13713	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki dead hasn't sat in an audience of an award show (besides BET) in awhile. She can't be bothered with those YTs.
13714	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki does not have the time to be shady she will deadass drop the tea on ya lap and let you get a 3rd degree burn
13715	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki has no class? Mf got a fish in his avi. You get off to the smell of fish right? C'mon bitch step ya dick up, TWEET @ ME. @dmart4511
13716	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is always feuding with somebody. Lil Kim, Mariah Carey, Iggy Azalea, Taylor Swift, now Miley Cyrus... I like her but c'mon
13717	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is gonna open with trini dem girls on the pinkprint tour in south africa on the 2nd leg
13718	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki just gave this pastor a shout out but didn't attend Sunday school last Sunday. Man please.
13719	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may be thinking it's better to confront her, as other people will think they can try it too. Which is true. Just my opinion.
13720	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may have called Miley out but Miley's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the VMAs
13721	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may have forgiven Taylor... but I still think she's corny for what she did.
13722	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may look Hollywood, but you hear every bit of New York when she opens her mouth.
13723	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight. #VMAs
13724	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki went from I want to thank my Pastor to cursing at Miley. That may beat what Kanye did to Taylor Swift.
13725	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki's pastor is mad af right now. And it's Sunday smh
13726	nicki	UNKNOWN	No really Nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight
13727	nicki	UNKNOWN	Not if nicki is gone be in it  https://t.co/bftjyZZFFz
13728	nicki	UNKNOWN	Oh shit Nicki and Mikey gone be in the same room tomorrow I wonder if Mikey gone talk all that shit then #VMAs
13729	nicki	UNKNOWN	Okay....I'll admit it...Taylor did a good job performing with Nicki...I will be performing my own lobotomy tomorrow....Bye
13730	nicki	UNKNOWN	One of pop music's ugliest feuds kicked off at the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday when Nicki... http://t.co/ZmqJoAmkfA
13731	nicki	UNKNOWN	Part of me thinks Nicki is so serious about her attitude towards Miley tho. She may be cool with her but she was a little serious. #VMAs
13732	nicki	UNKNOWN	Performing with black artist doesn't take away the fact that Nicki gave you a 3rd degree burn with her tea hunty.  https://t.co/tfVO1VQJof
13733	nicki	UNKNOWN	Power's out for 47 hrs and: #kanye2020 , twenty one pilots perform, Nicki drags Miley, probably the sun exploded too let me check
13734	nicki	UNKNOWN	Remember that time Wayne ran across the show to help Nicki up the stairs but tn Meek just sat in his seat while my mom had to wait for Rebel
13735	nicki	UNKNOWN	Remember this when you watch the news stories about Nicki tomorrow morning. http://t.co/ql1hPfQ7O7
13736	nicki	UNKNOWN	School tomorrow is gonna be fired up HA! you got something to say bad about Nicki? Prepare your argument you're bout to get shut down
13737	nicki	UNKNOWN	She said something about Nicki? How dare she...the actual question is who is she like seriously is she famous or sum https://t.co/0W0VOtfVdj
13738	nicki	UNKNOWN	Snaps to Nicki! I may not like her but get it https://t.co/nsJxJTuuRK
13739	nicki	UNKNOWN	So Meek just sat on his ass and didn't walk Nicki up to the stage?  #VMAs2015
13740	nicki	UNKNOWN	So Miley don't know Nicki from Southside Jamaica Queens. Where people slap you because it's Tuesday.
13741	nicki	UNKNOWN	Stop it Nicki said all that behind a smile https://t.co/VdEWp6aRLe
13742	nicki	UNKNOWN	Taylor told Nicki weeks ago she can come on stage if she wins an award &amp; Nicki was "nah bitch ima bring you on stage so I can do it 1st"
13743	nicki	UNKNOWN	That's how you handle a beef lil ass nigg. - Nicki to Meek after she sat down from receiving the award.
13744	nicki	UNKNOWN	The sad part about this is tomorrow Nicki will be the angry black woman who went after poor white girl Miley
13745	nicki	UNKNOWN	This may be unexpected but I found a very special lady with similar personalities! Nicki and Miley beef is over! @misstaylertexas
13746	nicki	UNKNOWN	Tomorrow at work, when people talk to me, I'm just going to slap my crotch and twerk in response. See if I get the same reaction Nicki did.
13747	nicki	UNKNOWN	Wait, did Taylor bring Nicki on stage when she won on Sunday? I didn't think so...
13748	nicki	UNKNOWN	Watch Nicki call Miley out. Watch Miley's reaction. Watch Rebel's "whoa" in the background. C'mon, BuzzFeed. Let us collectively get a life.
13749	nicki	UNKNOWN	What I love most about this is that every hag will be on DCUM tomorrow talking a t how trashy Nicki or Bey is. When clearly...#VMAs
13750	nicki	UNKNOWN	What these white people at school tomorrow have SO MUCH to say about Nicki!!!!! #ImReady
13751	nicki	UNKNOWN	What's good this Thursday? #TBT to Nicki and Miley's heated exchange at the #VMAs! #MileyWhatsGood : https://t.co/dPVOiXezx8
13752	nicki	UNKNOWN	When Lil' Kim made Black Friday she was a villain, but Nicki gets praised for calling out Miley at the VMAs when Miley barely said anything
13753	nicki	UNKNOWN	Where's Nicki's style or her 2nd 1mil sold album?? Keep changing topics when u get clocked,its right here with u https://t.co/fLxP74dTI8
13754	nicki	UNKNOWN	White feminism will be all over the newspapers tomorrow saying how Nicki attacked Miley. That's you call someone out!!!!
13755	nicki	UNKNOWN	You know Gaga was cackling as she made her 6th sacrificial offering of the day while Nicki called out Miley last night

13765	nicki	UNKNOWN	she said "it may be funny Nicki said that to Miley but now the media is going to take Miley's side, you know they're going portray Nicki-"
13766	nicki	UNKNOWN	so @Abbij1798 her ex texted her &amp; spelled Nicki "niki" that's his first problem. 2nd problem is he doesn't know I go to CA &amp; I always tweet?
13767	nicki	UNKNOWN	sorry mom I can't go to school tomorrow, I need time to cope with Nicki killing Miley

13774	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
13775	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Likeitornotmama @LILKIMQOR Its not... Nicki garnered the success she has today because of what her 2nd album entailed AND the look.
13776	nicki	UNKNOWN	@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
13777	nicki	UNKNOWN	@LuxxSOCIAL @Raheem_TM it may have have gotten a higher score never denied that fact....but Nicki's album is STILL critically acclaimed. Lol

13781	nicki	UNKNOWN	@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
13782	nicki	UNKNOWN	@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul.
13783	nicki	UNKNOWN	@anaaheartbeat @Aliina57 I'm watching the red carpet for Nicki mostly. They're gonna air the show tomorrow night so I might go to bed after
13784	nicki	UNKNOWN	@barkycarly @aimeeorleans I feel like I planned my whole day wrong. I gotta get ready for class tomorrow. BUT I JUSR T WANNA WATCH NICKI

13786	nicki	UNKNOWN	@gregnisall @ENews Anaconda video got 19 million views in 24 hours, so whatever you may think of Nicki personally, she has a point.
13787	nicki	UNKNOWN	@kiaspeaks oh. I may have been watching a marathon of who do you think you are on tlc. Wasn't paying attention to Twitter. Good for Nicki!
13788	nicki	UNKNOWN	@mari_fminaj @THEQUEEN0FRAPI do not know, Pink Friday has the best song Nicki: Super Bass but the pinkprint has invincible like Anaconda

13796	nicki	UNKNOWN	Did you know that 'Nicki' was Trending Topic on Tuesday 1 for 4 hours in Las Vegas? http://t.co/LxJcwMPwbk #trndnl
13797	nicki	UNKNOWN	Every day I thank god that Nicki recycled I Love You n put it on Pink Friday as Your Love
13798	nicki	UNKNOWN	Everyone came to the VMAs looking boring or like trash (from what I see so far), and then Nicki showed up looking like a sun goddess.
13799	nicki	UNKNOWN	Everyone in my feminist studies class was team Nicki AND the Mitski tinydesk was released today WHAT A MONDAY !!!!
13800	nicki	UNKNOWN	I CAN'T WAIT to see Nicki at the VMA'S tomorrow
13801	nicki	UNKNOWN	I bet Nicki has like a 3rd of the industry shaking in their boots. Plus the Barbz will drag if anyone comes for her.

13803	nicki	UNKNOWN	I could have sat on Nicki's ass tonight
13804	nicki	UNKNOWN	I feel like so much happened on the VMAs.  Kanye, Taylor, Nicki and Miley, Miley released new music.. The news is gonna be CRAY tomorrow.
13805	nicki	UNKNOWN	I have a feeling that Nicki's performance at the VMAs  will be the only good one tomorrow
13806	nicki	UNKNOWN	I hope Nicki attends the Givenchy show Friday.
13807	nicki	UNKNOWN	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/oyey81EYQ5 Nicki Minaj - Dear Old Nicki with lyrics - Pink Friday

13817	nicki	UNKNOWN	I'm gonna watch Nicki's opening tonight then watch the rest tomorrow

13828	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki had the most consecutive weeks in the Top 10 by a female artist with 'Pink Friday'. http://t.co/al6op9AXC4
13829	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is FED UP! When she 1st came out she was bashed for her creativity, her body, her music. Now her opinions. I don't blame her.
13830	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is a great woman I don't care what you say. I may don't like her music a lot but she's very intelligent.
13831	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is so hot and out of all the fine qualities she has, her teeth just may be my fav one. Not her butt, but her teeth.
13832	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is the most talked about tonight and will be tomorrow. No doubt!
13833	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is the only reason my HW gets done tbh.  https://t.co/hyzutcbTuT
13834	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki is truly a loving and forgiving God, may we all show the same mercy she has shown to taylor to those who have wronged us. Amen.
13835	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may be a black woman but you're forget shes a RICH BLACK WOMAN!
13836	nicki	UNKNOWN	Nicki may not be a vocalist but she sure doesn't sound a mess when she sings  https://t.co/MumZ7ZKK8c

13841	nicki	UNKNOWN	Overall...tonight reconfirmed my love for nicki and why I never went back to side bangs after 7th grade
13842	nicki	UNKNOWN	Pink Friday is Nicki's best.  And the Pink Print is a sloppy mess.
13843	nicki	UNKNOWN	Pretty sure Nicki's ass is the 8th wonder of the world
13844	nicki	UNKNOWN	Professor: "read 8 chapters by Friday" Me: @ Nicki I hope you know I'm doing this for you
13845	nicki	UNKNOWN	Remember the times we used to fast forward songs to Nicki's parts? Now she'll slay with a 3rd album out. Onika gurl. I love it.

13850	nicki	UNKNOWN	They girls still didn't get a selfie with Nicki n I was actually hoping for that more than the award. May the manips continue to rise smh
13851	nicki	UNKNOWN	What a great weekend. First Drake was in the 'Ville Saturday then Nicki went for Miley's life tonight. What a time to be alive
13852	nicki	UNKNOWN	What makes me sad is how tomorrow morning, the media is gonna portray Nicki as the stereotypical "angry black woman" &amp; make Miley the victim
13853	nicki	UNKNOWN	When Nicki came into the game Bey was working on her 4th solo #1 album after selling millions, so for Nicki to share the same stage is a lot
13854	nicki	UNKNOWN	Why do y'all want Nicki to be pregnant so bad like maybe around the 7th album but she's literally still in her prime.
13855	nicki	UNKNOWN	Y'all was gna be mad at Nicki anyway. She just stole all the headlines for tomorrow, keep fuming bitches! New Queen of the VMA's.
13856	nicki	UNKNOWN	Y'all, she may have made a pop album, but Nicki can kill almost anyone in this industry right now. Gun to the head of everybody.
13857	nicki	UNKNOWN	after the VMAs last night, Nicki gave me the courage to stand up against my math teacher who wrongfullyy marked me absent last thursday
13858	nicki	UNKNOWN	cue the mountain of thinkpieces about nicki's "aggression" and "internalized misogyny." looking forward to tomorrow.
13859	nicki	UNKNOWN	hi Nicki u famous n I know, but ama keep it short. I love u dearly, though u n d world may think am crazy cos De say I write blindly.

13869	nicki	UNKNOWN	taylor may have won against nicki and bey but she did fart on live tv so i think nicki and bey are the real winners
13870	nicki	UNKNOWN	the 2nd and 4th are nicki's best vma looks. http://t.co/M3HfbkQguJ
13871	nicki	UNKNOWN	when taylor joined Nicki I just sat there like.....

16172	rousey	UNKNOWN	1st we are out and see Tayshaun Prince; @Casey_Hart14 has no idea who he is. 2nd I ask if he knows who Rousey is. "She that wrestlin bitch?"
16173	rousey	UNKNOWN	@DavyWhite hope solo would make it to the 2nd round, then make Rousey's head explode with a death stare
16174	rousey	UNKNOWN	@MarioMelchiot Rousey my dear, aim higher please. What's in it to waste time with a lizard shit 'runner'?   C'mon!
16175	rousey	UNKNOWN	@ThaSJ101 wrestling guru @GregNecroBlack tells us why Rousey may not be the best UFC fighter ever https://t.co/oX8LaGLxiR @SportsTalkRT
16176	rousey	UNKNOWN	@YahooSports I hope she beats her Ass.Rousey may be a converted guy for all we know. Truly, who cares!meh2490.
16177	rousey	UNKNOWN	@_WhitePonyJr_ @Fugazi3011 @BenSotoKarass C'mon bro,you know Rousey isn't this hot
16178	rousey	UNKNOWN	@bomani_jones the same Rousey fans tht scream Money May doesn't fight anyone, be the first to make an excuse as to why Rousey won't move up
16179	rousey	UNKNOWN	@criscyborg I cant see Rousey fighting you Jan 2 because she's filming a movie after &amp; u would destroy her face. You deserve the big payday
16180	rousey	UNKNOWN	@itstheryguy Rousey is not the Hero we deserve https://t.co/QcKApSjdqC
16181	rousey	UNKNOWN	Cyborg and her management now calling for an April bout with Rousey ...lol..that didn't last long..fuck Cyborg already...
16182	rousey	UNKNOWN	Don't tell me Rousey pulling a Mayweather and ducking fighters now. If Cyborg says she is down for December, make it happen.
16183	rousey	UNKNOWN	Drake went in on meek again, it's all over! The only beating worse than this was the one Rousey delivered on Saturday
16184	rousey	UNKNOWN	I don't want Rousey to be Captain Marvel! She may be strong enough but she's not pretty enough.
16185	rousey	UNKNOWN	I love Meisha Tate,not a Rousey fan really,but I can't see the sense in a 3rd fight,it's gonna take a man to beat Ronda any time soon #UFC
16186	rousey	UNKNOWN	I was finally warming up to a 3rd fight with Tate, and then the UFC goes and throws a Holm-run ball to Rousey. I don't get it.....
16187	rousey	UNKNOWN	If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
16188	rousey	UNKNOWN	If you really think Rousey can be Mayweather I cannot take you serious at all.... This is a MAN fighting a WOMAN c'mon now
16189	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey gon get schooled by the preachers kid, ya diggggg???  https://t.co/w4AWY52J9j
16190	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey keeps running her mouth like the 3rd grader with a crush.
16191	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey vs. Holm may be the biggest waste of a UFC card I've ever seen.
16192	rousey	UNKNOWN	The Rousey Era is over. ROUSEY VS. HOLM January 2nd. @_HOLLYHOLM is just that much better. #UFC
16193	rousey	UNKNOWN	The complete stupidity of the WWE constantly kissing up to Rousey when she has no say in if she can do Mania http://t.co/ldZ1qSo1Bj #RAW
16194	rousey	UNKNOWN	Why is Rousey worried bout money may pay and I'm pretty sure they not even in the same tax bracket
16195	rousey	UNKNOWN	#UFC192 in Houston but waiting for @ufc to make McGregor vs Aldo, Rousey vs Tate December 5th in Dallas official
16196	rousey	UNKNOWN	'' Cyborg ' going to reach 135 pounds to combat Rousey in December #Breakingnews# http://t.co/AouFuItfLe
16197	rousey	UNKNOWN	1st time in my life I agree with Brock Lesnar about his Rousey comment. #UFC #WWE
16198	rousey	UNKNOWN	@AngelaMagana1 you may be accurate there but Rousey's next fight is just too early , Holm needs more fights before getting walked on
16199	rousey	UNKNOWN	@BrianTh27809143 Now @danawhite makes it sound like Tate fighting Rousey twice is a news flash! He already announced their 3rd fight Senile?
16200	rousey	UNKNOWN	@BustedOpenRadio @KeepItFiveStar Hearing Dana White wants UFC in Dec at ATT Stadium in Dallas 3 months before WM32 with Rousey. #HEEL
16201	rousey	UNKNOWN	@CageRage7 @FrontRowBrian Styles make fights. Rousey may very well win but there's no way she is running through Holm.
16202	rousey	UNKNOWN	@ClayTravisBGID I like your work but that Money May V. Rousey is ludicrous. I couldn't even finish reading it.
16203	rousey	UNKNOWN	@ClayTravisBGID can't believe all the negative response to Rousey article. Fight needs to happen. She'd drop him in 1st round!
16204	rousey	UNKNOWN	@DamonMartin Underdog Holm has LESS time to prepare for Rousey. Not calling conspiracy just saying she's not ready. Jan 2 was too soon. #mma
16205	rousey	UNKNOWN	@DraftKings Ringside for Mayweather fight so i could heckle that Rousey would have had the fight finished in the 1st round #DKMillionaire
16206	rousey	UNKNOWN	@Dustin_LongNJ Seriously. May as well just watch WWE at this point. At least you know it's a front. I mean Rousey vs. Holm? C'mon.
16207	rousey	UNKNOWN	@HelloJapan1 @Chris81203 @TP_Grant  i wouldn't be that harsh. she may exploit holes in Rousey's standup game.   ...maybe.
16208	rousey	UNKNOWN	@HiMyNameIsSeton  @andrewperloff  tell DP It Rousey's first fight with Correia but she's going to fight Meisha Tate for a 3rd time next.
16209	rousey	UNKNOWN	@JESnowden agreed, but @RondaRousey will be better prepared for that come Jan 2.    the real key to beating Rousey is to outpoint her
16210	rousey	UNKNOWN	@Juliomc69 it just gets me hot people trash may for being cocky but not Rousey
16211	rousey	UNKNOWN	@KCCINews this is news?  Rly?  Lol.  If in the ring with Rousey, I too, would run away.  Older and fatter than Lolo I may not last a minute!
16212	rousey	UNKNOWN	@MMAFighting @davedoylemma No she was not robbed. She will NEVER beat Rousey and Nobody is interested in watching her lose for the 3rd time
16213	rousey	UNKNOWN	@MeiaLua22 Rousey may not be afraid of her now, but she was DEFINITELY afraid of her in Strikeforce,
16214	rousey	UNKNOWN	@MieshaTate So pumped that you worked your way back up Miesha &amp; I know you'll get the W in the 3rd fight with Rousey! http://t.co/CERCEl1pLJ
16215	rousey	UNKNOWN	@PatDStat Brunch with Rousey and a light job with Bolt on Friday IMO.
16216	rousey	UNKNOWN	@SedanoESPN Bored w. Rousey Now, she might b fightin Tate a 3rd Time already, Ronda is UConn of UFC Women, not her fault but no competition
16217	rousey	UNKNOWN	@SportsCenter @TMZ he should watch lil guy round Rousey weight class may be a knew billie king in the making
16218	rousey	UNKNOWN	@StaceGots I feel like Bomani vs. Rovell intellectually is roughly equivalent to Rousey vs. a 4th grader in the octagon.
16219	rousey	UNKNOWN	@TStape03 Rousey is going to destroy again. Waiting for her to finally fight Cyborg. I think CM Punk may end up fighting Cathal Pendred.
16220	rousey	UNKNOWN	@TheNotoriousMMA UFC195 jan 2nd. aldo vs mcgregor, rousey vs tate. AT LEAST $13M gate alone. just dip into that money to bring you pal over
16221	rousey	UNKNOWN	@TheZaneSimon If Rousey retired tomorrow do you see anyone who would hold the belt for awhile or do you think it would get passed around?
16222	rousey	UNKNOWN	@Theodoregrammar that's a legit point man. I have to agree. Rousey would take that, but I think Browne would be the first to escape 1st rd.
16223	rousey	UNKNOWN	@UFCTonight Replace Rousey v. Tate III and add Rousey v. Chris Justino, all due respect, I don't want to see Tate get beat for a 3rd time.
16224	rousey	UNKNOWN	@ULTMMA Cyborg did nothing (for lack of a better term) to progress WMMA and now suddenly the narrative is Rousey's ducking her? C'mon.
16225	rousey	UNKNOWN	@Wolfman42069 @JoshSamman Just think there may be more interesting match-ups for Rousey (spoiler: she still wins) than ANOTHER rematch.
16226	rousey	UNKNOWN	@arielhelwani Counting Holms, this will be the 3rd opponent in a row that has a 9-0 record before fighting Rousey. #UFC
16227	rousey	UNKNOWN	@arielhelwani Let Rousey and Tate fight and have Cyborg on the same card at 135. If Rousey and Cyborg both win then have the fight in April
16228	rousey	UNKNOWN	@bdf522 No way she makes it past the 1st rd. She has had a rough transition to MMA she is in no way near prepared for Rousey
16229	rousey	UNKNOWN	@calamityford  Going intn med overdrive with Chynna and Rousey. Symptoms. : / Wondering if fleas may b catalyst. Grr!  Coffee time! HUGSXO
16230	rousey	UNKNOWN	@dacanes3 yeah. I just expect cyborg to accuse the UFC and Rousey of being afraid of her when the dec fight doesn't get booked.
16231	rousey	UNKNOWN	@danawhite I'm telling you, one of these Brazilians may be lucky enough to put an end to Rousey's reign. Nunes is an up-and-coming opponent.
16232	rousey	UNKNOWN	@danawhite McGregor vs Aldo and Rousey vs Tate 3 December 5th, Dallas, TX AT&amp;T Stadium....sound good to you?
16233	rousey	UNKNOWN	@danawhite The 2nd time in the UFC to beat Rousey and a 3rd time to beat Rousey in a rematch. Then she said she's done at 135.
16234	rousey	UNKNOWN	@danawhite is it true that you weren't 1st to tell Miesha she wasn't getting the Rousey fight? Understand why you went with Holly but c'mon
16235	rousey	UNKNOWN	@danawhite wait a tick Nunes cannot fight Tate forgot she is set to fight Rousey again for the 10th time lol j/k
16236	rousey	UNKNOWN	@dannyodwyer McGregor vs Aldo coming Dec.12. So, we going halvsies on PPV? Ha. They need to hurry up and throw Rousey vs. Cyborg on there.
16237	rousey	UNKNOWN	@girl_fights it may be different but the ending would still see Rousey with the W.
16238	rousey	UNKNOWN	@jeremybotter @AdamHillLVRJ if Rousey got hit with 9 significant strikes Sat I'm passing.may take Cyborg if enough $$$ comes in on Rousey
16239	rousey	UNKNOWN	@mcdiana I thought it was over like a Rousey fight. It may go into 4th qtr.
16240	rousey	UNKNOWN	@nnamzzz @SBNLukeThomas I agree, unfair. I'd like to see the Rousey fight 1st too. I don't see fight happening without Cyborg thro backdoor
16241	rousey	UNKNOWN	@rlbonesio she may not be ready for Rousey yet.
16242	rousey	UNKNOWN	@rnoliveira81 @criscyborg   happy to put the fight together tomorrow if the Brazilian slugger can cut down to 135 pounds to face Rousey
16243	rousey	UNKNOWN	@wado_mac Tate loses to Rousey for a 3rd time. what does she do? Keep beating contenders and earn a 4th shot nobody wants to watch
16244	rousey	UNKNOWN	@washingtonpost @DesBieler there are people who like/support Trump but don't want to admit it..may not be Rousey though
16245	rousey	UNKNOWN	After watching Amanda Nunes' fight on Saturday, it's clear the @ufc will begin work on Rousey vs. Nunes. One for the books.
16246	rousey	UNKNOWN	Aldo v Mcgregor and Tate v Rousey in Dallas in December... I think it's time to make a trip to Texas.

16250	rousey	UNKNOWN	Bethe Correia called Rousey out again? Clearly she had a few screws knocked loose on Saturday night.
16251	rousey	UNKNOWN	Bethe Correia still thinks she can beat Rousey and that Santa Claus is coming december 25th.
16252	rousey	UNKNOWN	Check out the replay of @CTSportsRadio from Tues as we talk Rousey, CFB Playoff predictions, and our NFL team previews right now &amp; all day!

16255	rousey	UNKNOWN	Floyd May to Ronda Rousey: "Make $300M in 36 minutes, then call me"  Rousey: "Read a Dr.Seuss book all the way to the eend, then call me"
16256	rousey	UNKNOWN	Floyd says he's #1 all-time &amp; Ali is 5th. Agree? Who is your top 5? Rousey says she can take Floyd in no rules fight. True?.....855-212-4227

16258	rousey	UNKNOWN	Happy Tuesday... this is late, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who things that the Rousey fight was stopped prematurely.  You?
16259	rousey	UNKNOWN	Holly Holm's boxing may give her the ability to out point Rousey on the feet but what's her take down defence like?
16260	rousey	UNKNOWN	Holm for Rousey on Jan. 2nd, not Cupcake. Haven't been even slightly impressed with Holm yet. That's another paddling. #AndStill
16261	rousey	UNKNOWN	Holm isn't quite ready for Rousey. But I'm with @_HOLLYHOLM  https://t.co/Ejd8hXmfJB
16262	rousey	UNKNOWN	Holm won't beat Rousey. She may land a few good punches but she'll get dropped on her head and submitted. #UFCNashville
16263	rousey	UNKNOWN	I don't see the point in the 3rd Tate vs Rousey fight, it's not like they both have a win a piece, Ronda has clattered her both times.
16264	rousey	UNKNOWN	I don't think Nunes wins in a match up versus Rousey but it's an intriguing match up for sure. https://t.co/S4QUGDojfh
16265	rousey	UNKNOWN	I hate to succumb to the thought but Rousey just may be The Juggernaut.  https://t.co/IX2nZSvSp6
16266	rousey	UNKNOWN	I may pull out the hair I don't have if I see another Rousey vs. Mayweather headline.
16267	rousey	UNKNOWN	I will wait for the weigh in. Rousey changed her body too much and may have too many things on her plate. I'll know my bet after weigh in
16268	rousey	UNKNOWN	I wonder if the Bella Twins will be at Teen Choice tomorrow since they're nominated. Probably gonna lose to Rousey, though.
16269	rousey	UNKNOWN	If Rousey runs throught Tate the 3rd time around, the Cyborg, Rousey fight has to happen. Or just let her clean out the whole division
16270	rousey	UNKNOWN	If Rousey's fighting in Oz, that mean I can be out &amp; about on a 'pretty nice little Saturday' of errands as white brahs Twitter slobber?
16271	rousey	UNKNOWN	Interesting. BetOnline just opened Rousey -1250 vs. Holm, almost identical odds to those set for 3rd Tate bout. Expect different take at 5d.
16272	rousey	UNKNOWN	Just watched Rousey's enterance from Saturday again she blinked once while on cam. Didn't blink at all once she saw Bethe....scary focus

16333	rousey	UNKNOWN	@CuseCarla Now you got me on the hunt for tickets event in Houston in Oct! Learn that Rousey arm bar! She needs a good challenger :)
16334	rousey	UNKNOWN	@FloydMayweather u may b on Forbes but ur dumbass will go bankrupt eventually. Rousey is smart with her money unlike ur dumdass

16336	rousey	UNKNOWN	@MikeAndMike Rousey over Floyd everyday of the week and twice on Sunday. #BestFight
16337	rousey	UNKNOWN	@RebsAllin @VegasRebs I think you may be underestimating the difference in boxing and mma. Rousey has all the advantage.
16338	rousey	UNKNOWN	@RondaRousey It's gonna be hard enjoying Christmas knowing you're facing Rousey on 2nd January. Yeah, good luck with that one :D
16339	rousey	UNKNOWN	@TheBlackTaco13 I'll get to see Rousey with you in Jan!
16340	rousey	UNKNOWN	@WMMANews @MMARising I give  Rousey a lot of credit .. she want the first but she convinced so may that women can sell events
16341	rousey	UNKNOWN	@WWENXT @BaronCorbinWWE I think that was faster win then the rousey fight on Saturday Night!
16342	rousey	UNKNOWN	@chadnotweet Idk, seems like there r plenty of Rousey fans &amp; not just in the US. They may not be UFC fans but they'll pay big $$$ 2 see her.
16343	rousey	UNKNOWN	@duresport @JESnowden Yes truly. Oh and Rousey really is a world class Judoka for all the comments about 3rd place. https://t.co/bnVYsWy6f0
16344	rousey	UNKNOWN	@gma broke the story for @RondaRousey fight. As if Rousey couldn't get cooler, she is bringing MMA mainstream https://t.co/liMDO9XJho
16345	rousey	UNKNOWN	@itsbktime but the difference is thay Rousey will fight whoever they throw at her and may picks his fights
16346	rousey	UNKNOWN	@kaponofor3 Rousey and Stephanie may beat her to it but I know what you mean. She's a special talent.
16347	rousey	UNKNOWN	@simonhead Rousey will just take her down and submit her. She may have to take a few punches to achieve this.
16348	rousey	UNKNOWN	Always fun reading about Rousey's love for Pokemon and DBZ https://t.co/zQiGmV4zwR
16349	rousey	UNKNOWN	And the wonder years and state champs are touring together and I get to see my first Rousey fight in Dec? I keep getting good news today
16350	rousey	UNKNOWN	Dear Ms. Rousey, may I be your Pre-fight Fluffer? I promise I'll spike your testosterone &amp; make u win. Sincerely, Winky @RondaRousey #UFC195
16351	rousey	UNKNOWN	December 5th could be the biggest UFC Card put together. Aldo &amp; McGregor, and Rousey as a co main event with her possibly fighting Cyborg.
16352	rousey	UNKNOWN	Forbes highest paid women's athlete was Sharapova (11th yr straight) with 29.2 mil. Not hard to imagine Rousey topping that list one day.
16353	rousey	UNKNOWN	Holm doesn't have enough MMA experience. She's going to get schooled. Rousey will simply demolished her. #UFC195  https://t.co/3544ac712v
16354	rousey	UNKNOWN	Huh?! Holm isn't ready. Nothing in her previous fights makes me think she can beat Rousey. https://t.co/ygDbMXlYZe
16355	rousey	UNKNOWN	I did laundry and didn't lose a SINGLE sock in the process and they moved the Rousey v. Holm fight to Nov 14. Today is a good day!!!!!
16356	rousey	UNKNOWN	I need a big moment!  Something like a clutch moment! A Kobe in the 4th quarter!  A Ronda "Rowdy" Rousey 14 second knockout!
16357	rousey	UNKNOWN	I would say him and Rousey are the hottest athletes in sports right now. SAVAGE  https://t.co/y4aCXXw0Aj
16358	rousey	UNKNOWN	I'm on board with this. Feel bad for Miesha Tate, but looking at Rousey's dominance, the opponent doesn't matter. https://t.co/CBLF1GpBnk
16359	rousey	UNKNOWN	If Aldo vs McGregor AND Rousey vs Cyborg are both booked for UFC 194 at Cowboy Stadium, I just have to be there! https://t.co/qGGiPhH8He
16360	rousey	UNKNOWN	If McGregor and Rousey are scheduled on December 5 in Dallas, I will be there even if it's just by myself.
16361	rousey	UNKNOWN	Meisha Tate MIGHT have lost to Rousey twice BUT is still deserving of a 3rd shot cause she earned it by grinding in the #UFC
16362	rousey	UNKNOWN	My 62 year old father knew Rousey's fight date before me. Knew it was November but not date. He chimes in "oh yeah she fights Nov 14"
16363	rousey	UNKNOWN	No one else may be able to sanction it, but Rousey vs. Mayweather (in some capacity) can work in #WWE
16364	rousey	UNKNOWN	People always wanna be the next MJ, the next Rousey, I just wanna be the best me. I may go further than those so why limit myself?
16365	rousey	UNKNOWN	Personally I would have loved to see Rousey vs Tate III, but Dana just announced... Rousey vs Holly Holm on January 2nd for #UFC195

16369	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey firing back at May. Ha, love it.
16370	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey is about to kill Hollie Holm in January. My guess is 16 seconds #UFC195 #bantemweightchampuonship
16371	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey may be hot, but @LaurenPisciotta is the true bae http://t.co/0j3O93swwl
16372	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey may not have the money that Floyd has, but people respect her way more.  https://t.co/ML43TY292L
16373	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey obliterated Correia on Saturday! Is she the most dominant @ufc fighter ever? #ufc190 #RondaRousey
16374	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey still going to KO her in the 2nd round  https://t.co/yLhe0oXfxS
16375	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey vs Holm's on January 2. Holms has the best kicks of any ufc woman fighter. I'll give her at least 2 minutes with rousey
16376	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey was right. You know you'll get beat, you just want the $ https://t.co/66YDin4uq8
16377	rousey	UNKNOWN	Rousey would make may weather tap out.She would knock the 's of that fraud and fake . She loves the sport while the clown does it for the $
16378	rousey	UNKNOWN	SIGH. Not really huge news in my opinion, but don't get me wrong I'm excited for Rousey &amp; Holm in Australia and seeing it sooner than Jan 2.
16379	rousey	UNKNOWN	Sat for 3 hours in a restaurant to watch Rousey for 34 sec. &amp; I would do it again!!! #Rousey #BestFight @MikeAndMike @Espngreeny
16380	rousey	UNKNOWN	So it's totally possible Rousey wins quickly in November (as usual) then headlines the Vegas January 2nd card. @danawhite

17397	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work
17398	sharknado	UNKNOWN	A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you.
17399	sharknado	UNKNOWN	All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
17400	sharknado	UNKNOWN	How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
17401	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
17402	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
17403	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh
17404	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
17405	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I figured Sharknado was played out at #2 &amp; tonight we get #3?   I won't be watching, just like the 1st 2
17406	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
17407	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
17408	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way.
17409	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
17410	sharknado	UNKNOWN	It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
17411	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen
17412	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
17413	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?
17414	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity.
17415	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.
17416	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q
17417	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason
17418	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day
17419	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...
17420	sharknado	UNKNOWN	The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado
17421	sharknado	UNKNOWN	The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3
17422	sharknado	UNKNOWN	The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
17423	sharknado	UNKNOWN	The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3
17424	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul
17425	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
17426	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Why does someone make the effort to produce a 3rd movie of Sharknado anyways lmao
17427	sharknado	UNKNOWN	may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
17428	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
17429	sharknado	UNKNOWN	It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
17430	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
17431	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
17432	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
17433	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
17434	sharknado	UNKNOWN	#AprilLives  No Sharknado without April.  Love a chick with a sawhand
17435	sharknado	UNKNOWN	#Dodgers roll after Sharknado.  That's just fact. https://t.co/ljNBMAl22k

17447	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@StilettoRoyalty They will replay the hell out of Sharknado 3. It'll be on all the time. We can always do it late tonight or probably Thurs.
17448	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@TaraReid    Sharknado without Tara Reid is just not Sharknado , might as well call it nonado if no April #AprilLives #Sharknado3
17449	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@TaraReid #AprilLives @SharknadoSyfy what's the point in Sharknado without April? She makes the movie.
17450	sharknado	UNKNOWN	@bradkeselowski I may just have to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow haha

17482	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I finally saw Sharknado 1 &amp; 2 for the first time at my pal's house on Saturday. I disagree with Australian man dying? Why would you do this.
17483	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I haven't seen any of the Sharknado movies but I'm guessing it's sort of like this. https://t.co/oIuwePWNYr

17582	sharknado	UNKNOWN	April is the best part of sharknado! If April dies, Sharknado will jump the shark @TaraReid #AprilLives #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo #AprilLives

17585	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Can it just be tomorrow so I can see @CassieScerbo in Sharknado 3 #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo
17586	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Can't wait for tomorrow . . . won't have to hear about Sharknado anymore.
17587	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Columbus friends, are any of you willing to go see the Sharknado 3 premier with me tomorrow night? Actual party downtown, not a theatre!
17588	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Cost of running the 1st advertisement in Sharknado 3 probably rivals the Super Bowl. Nice play there, @hotelsdotcom.
17589	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Dad said he can't go to party on the patio tomorrow because he needs to be home so he can watch Sharknado. Cool.
17590	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Enjoying Sharknado for the 3rd time in a row #Sharknado3
17591	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it.
17592	sharknado	UNKNOWN	From the makers of the Sharknado franchise comes a new movie on Saturday called Lavalantula. I must see this.
17593	sharknado	UNKNOWN	George is LIVE tweeting during the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow!  Join in! http://t.co/sPRT4dIn9L
17594	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
17595	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Good Thursday morning, #Weatherhounds! Glad to see y'all survived the Sharknado outbreak more or less intact.
17596	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
17597	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.

17599	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Hey @billengvall:  can't wait for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night! What is the name of your character?  Woo hoo!!  @SharknadoSyfy #GaryMartinHays
17600	sharknado	UNKNOWN	Hopefully y'all is still doing the vote for April thingy on sharknado! #AprilDies
17601	sharknado	UNKNOWN	How's everyone's Saturday night? Don't lie. Ur laying in your bed with your smartphone up in the air, with Sharknado 3 in the background.
17602	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I can't wait to go to the beach then watch sharknado tomorrow

17608	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I like Sharknado but I don't like the April character
17609	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I like that there's no messing around in Sharknado, just action. You don't even have to wait 10 mins for the 1st sharky sequence! #OhHellNo
17610	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
17611	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I may or may not have just DVR'd the Sharknado trilogy for Saturday. Can't wait to see what the hype is about. #sorrynotsorry
17612	sharknado	UNKNOWN	I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow.

18365	thor	UNKNOWN	I celebrate Christmas, @PrincessJules98, and I don't believe in Christ. Just like I call it Thursday but don't believe in Thor.
18366	thor	UNKNOWN	I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch. The Royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?

18404	thor	UNKNOWN	@MetsProspectHub there's no way Thor should start the 7th anyway

19387	u2	UNKNOWN	Now playing on #UrbanGold : U2 - Sunday Bloody Sunday  http://t.co/q9six47R1S 80's : Nothing but the best!
19388	u2	UNKNOWN	October and the trees are stripped bare Of all they wear What do I care? October and kingdoms rise And kingdoms fall But you go on and on U2
19389	u2	UNKNOWN	On 15 Aug 2009, U2's 1st UK gig on their current tour broke the attendance record for a Wembley Stadium concert with over 88,000 spectators!
19390	u2	UNKNOWN	On a Monday when I'm waiting for things that are stressing me, 1st song on the radio? I Still Haven't What I'm Looking For by U2. Thanks ar.
19391	u2	UNKNOWN	Radio just played U2's "Bad". Which rarely happens &amp; is one of my very favorite songs of all time so my day may have just peaked very early.
19392	u2	UNKNOWN	Sat what you want about U2, slag them off if you will, but I still think they were a damn fine class of submarine
19393	u2	UNKNOWN	Some band nearby playing U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday. That's better than the terrible music my neighbors usually play

19419	watchman	UNKNOWN	I don't blame Lee, though. If I understand it correctly, Watchman is basically the messy 1st draft to the masterpiece that is Mockingbird.
19420	watchman	UNKNOWN	I may never read "Watchman" after this review. What would be the point? https://t.co/C6G1DUO5RY
19421	watchman	UNKNOWN	So Watchman is an earlier draft of Mockingbird?? People have been had in getting excited for this. C'mon public, you're better than this.
19422	watchman	UNKNOWN	To all the people who will buy Go Set a Watchman tomorrow:  go buy/read To Kill a Mockingbird instead
19423	watchman	UNKNOWN	Worth reading. Another troubling argument for why the publication of "Watchman" may have been an act of elder abuse. https://t.co/QU0D4j3NIh
19424	watchman	UNKNOWN	#JonRonson is in the @guardian today, so I had to buy it, but 1st, I read about Go Set a Watchman and Daniel Kahneman and other stuff
19425	watchman	UNKNOWN	** Good! Because from the looks of it, Barnes &amp; Noble will be selling "Comes a Watchman" for firewood in November ** https://t.co/YW2WdxLcvd
19426	watchman	UNKNOWN	1st chapter of Go Set a Watchman previewed. Already surprised at some of it. Thoughts? @Berry_O12 @alaina_stowers http://t.co/sHxrdDr7zw
19427	watchman	UNKNOWN	@BBCNews You know Go Set a Watchman is not being released until tomorrow? Really did not appreciate the spoiler on your website.
19428	watchman	UNKNOWN	@CarisAdel a good question to reflect on by Le Guin, but I think both can be true. Or, Watchman may flesh out the reality of Mockingbird (1)
19429	watchman	UNKNOWN	@DrTimony I finished TKAM last Thursday! Let me know what you thing about Watchman
19430	watchman	UNKNOWN	@ElectricLit I honestly find it difficult to imagine a reader not knowing that Watchman was a 1st attempt with serious issues.
19431	watchman	UNKNOWN	@Michael22418062 Watchman was the 1st draft of Mockingbird, which was then changed beyond recognition. @kelly_carlin
19432	watchman	UNKNOWN	@SI_MaggieGray TKaMB is her favorite book and Atticus is (was) her favorite literary character. I hear Comes a Watchman was the 1st book
19433	watchman	UNKNOWN	@TODAY inaccurate reporting on Watchman. Its the 1st book HL wrote after many revisions by request of publisher came To kill A mockingbird!
19434	watchman	UNKNOWN	@diversemind sorry about that, I didn't see it! I'm going to peep the article, are you gonna buy "Watchman" tomorrow? And yes by the way.
19435	watchman	UNKNOWN	@madwags definitely wish we were reading together and enjoying a cup of tea!! @SchulerBooks BTW have you read the 1st chapter of Watchman?
19436	watchman	UNKNOWN	Brought my copy of Go Set a Watchman on a night out at da club so you can say I know how to go really hard on the scene on Saturday nights
19437	watchman	UNKNOWN	Called Watchman, same story as To Set a Watchman but from the Watchman's point of view? https://t.co/7xdyl43gOu
19438	watchman	UNKNOWN	Customers eager to read 'Go Set a Watchman,' buy it at midnight - York Daily Record/Sunday News http://t.co/Eqlcqt870M
19439	watchman	UNKNOWN	Details make Watchman's origins seem even more mysterious.  And now perhaps a 3rd book?  #GoSetAWatchman #HarperLee  https://t.co/l2XuPxxAxz
19440	watchman	UNKNOWN	Did you hear about Harper Lee's 3rd novel? ;) http://t.co/5PrB1SgzXU Don't forget to put Go Set a Watchman on hold at your library!

19442	watchman	UNKNOWN	Get the details behind the publication of Go Set a Watchman with a new documentary, out September 22. http://t.co/7seuuNO9gE
19443	watchman	UNKNOWN	Given that Watchman repeats passages whole, it seems Lee didn't want to publish a 2nd book so much as she wanted to correct Mockingbird.
19444	watchman	UNKNOWN	Go Set A Watchman initial reaction: oh no, it's a period romance. But I like what the Guardian did with the web stuff http://t.co/pxdXHRwkPU
19445	watchman	UNKNOWN	Go Set a Watchman comes out on Tuesday? Might read it. Or maybe I'll retread To Kill a Mockingbird first. Summer read number 4?

19456	watchman	UNKNOWN	Haven't read To Kill a Mockingbird in years. That may be a good thing for when I read Go Set a Watchman. Might make it less heartbreaking.
19457	watchman	UNKNOWN	Hearing that #ToKillAMockingbird and #GoSetAWatchman have identical passages gives more reason not to read it... Watchman is a 1st draft!
19458	watchman	UNKNOWN	Here's the first chapter of "Go Set a Watchman" for all of you readers out there http://t.co/EpZu12hHFJ

19475	watchman	UNKNOWN	Then you add in the guilt factor. Did Harper Lee really want Watchman published? If her 1st draft has been hijacked I'd feel bad reading it.
19476	watchman	UNKNOWN	Upset that the publishing company is acting like Go Set a Watchman is a new book.. really it's just the 1st draft of To Kill a Mockingbird
19477	watchman	UNKNOWN	Wait - Go Set A Watchman is really the 1st draft of Mockingbird? Then why is it being published as a separate novel?

19541	white sox	UNKNOWN	@bradfanningshow @KCTV5 Ya I know. I was frustrated &amp; had my 1st ever Twitter over reaction. It was more me just hate losing to White Sox.
19542	white sox	UNKNOWN	@motowncatscrown - Yep. Believe the Indians are in the 10th slot (lost today) and the White Sox are 11th (losing). Tigers 12th.
19543	white sox	UNKNOWN	@sbass1310 unfortunately, the White Sox haven't helped much this week. Hoping Samardzija can help tomorrow afternoon.
19544	white sox	UNKNOWN	Carlos Rodon (@CarlosRodon16) is on pace for his 5th straight Quality Start (6 IP, 1 ER, 4ks), but the White Sox are currently down 0-1
19545	white sox	UNKNOWN	I hate the White Sox with the white-hot heat of 1000 suns.  Do better tomorrow, Royals.
19546	white sox	UNKNOWN	I mean, the Tigers may be having a horrifying season but at least they don't have to wear those White Sox throwback uniforms
19547	white sox	UNKNOWN	I'm not kidding, the White Sox are running a promotion called "Selfie Sunday". And they wonder why they're the 2nd team in the 2nd city
19548	white sox	UNKNOWN	It's September 1st and this is what the White Sox are. It's sad to think about.
19549	white sox	UNKNOWN	Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck.

20372	zayn	UNKNOWN	@1DAFSanta  well they believed the sun when it talks shit about ZAYN but now the sun is the ultimate liar.
20373	zayn	UNKNOWN	@1DInsideReport haven't you heard, Zayn an Louis got married in Thailand. Just ask The Sun
20374	zayn	UNKNOWN	@1DZiamNews  and i can see  Zayn's long eyelashes in what looks like sun rays above the wing...
20375	zayn	UNKNOWN	@1DZiamNews liam got 29 tattooed on on his body, zayn left on the 25th, there are 4 members left, therefore ziam is real.
20376	zayn	UNKNOWN	@1ddms Hello do you have a dm with Zayn? I am looking for it since forever...may help me?
20377	zayn	UNKNOWN	@BasicallyPayne_ @Real_Liam_Payne ok... First thing first.. U gotta know the statement wasn't made by Zayn but management and the sun
20378	zayn	UNKNOWN	@ElleDevin @musicnews_shade @zaynmalik that's why Pierrie and Zayn are so pale. They haven't been seeing the sun bc they've been so shady
20379	zayn	UNKNOWN	@HeySarah_xo Syco/Columbia have OT5 signed for 5 albums and a greatest hits. That means Zayn has to work on the 5th album or else he breaks+
20380	zayn	UNKNOWN	@JanaehMariscal 2nd person didn't respond. Zayn is gone but do u want Calum?
20381	zayn	UNKNOWN	@LukeKorns then you would be so good that they would ask you to be there 5th member and you would mend there broken hearts after Zayn left
20382	zayn	UNKNOWN	@Nadene_Sewellxx I know what you mean my bday was on the 17th Zayn left on the 25
20383	zayn	UNKNOWN	@NiallOfficial zayn left on the 25th, school starts on the 25th, the 25th is just not a good day
20384	zayn	UNKNOWN	@OfficialWith1D no offense but zayn left on the 25th an my organs are on the g r o u  n d
20385	zayn	UNKNOWN	@OneDrecti0nFans what gonna happen tomorrow with Zayn?
20386	zayn	UNKNOWN	@Perfection7 I believe Zayn's return is due for Jan so he'll probably be at the Rumble. No idea what they'll do with Hideo.
20387	zayn	UNKNOWN	@aharryuser @paulstanworth either way its probably true rmbr when the sun said zayn was leaving and we laughed and then zayn left
20388	zayn	UNKNOWN	@brighteyedpezza Hold on the source that said Zayn dumped perrie over text was also the sun and 99% of LM fans believe it!
20389	zayn	UNKNOWN	@camrenspoetry zayn left on the 25th. i guess i should have added 1d BUT
20390	zayn	UNKNOWN	@daggeredxrose all I'm thinking about is how zayn left on March 25TH rip
20391	zayn	UNKNOWN	@danwootton and March is a funny month considering that will be the year anniversary since Zayn left
20392	zayn	UNKNOWN	@frankoniaz actually now they're all denying they ever believed the sun when it came to Zayn.....not even they can keep up with their BS
20393	zayn	UNKNOWN	@h0ranc0cain7 I had to drop a finger cause Zayn is gone and it was like March 25th all over again.
20394	zayn	UNKNOWN	@honestfandom The sun is shit in general! they made up bad thing about Zayn, the baby news, Harry and 'X' girl every day, homophobic Liam
20395	zayn	UNKNOWN	@idiot_vibez They didn't believe the Sun for a single second about Louis becoming a dad but they believe the Sun on anything to do with Zayn
20396	zayn	UNKNOWN	@itvthismorning was it strange filming for the 1st time without Zayn?  #1D
20397	zayn	UNKNOWN	@ljpzayn I just don't believe the Sun bc louis and Zayn said not to so I'm not believing anything until they confirm it
20398	zayn	UNKNOWN	@ollyofficial @TheXFactor Your mate should got through. After all he could sing look at Zayn When he 1st auditioned. X
20399	zayn	UNKNOWN	@presidents If that's true then Zayn hasn't left the band so you're okay. Wait till March, life might fall apart, sry
20400	zayn	UNKNOWN	@rnbzrince lol remember Zayn's old tweet that said to watch out for august 21st that's what we're joking about
20401	zayn	UNKNOWN	@tvmblrgcrl you think she's ugly only because Zayn may be dating her.Most y'all judge them bc you want to be the one dating Zayn or whatever
20402	zayn	UNKNOWN	@worthybieber No. The Sun is notorious for making up bullshit about Zayn including the cheating allegations.
20403	zayn	UNKNOWN	@xguccilou may be they dont wanna hurt the fans with zayn's pic with the boys!
20404	zayn	UNKNOWN	@xlotsoflouisx me too but Zayn was just on a break at 1st too so idk I'm still super scared
20405	zayn	UNKNOWN	@zhnllexposed It was a Article saying that Zayn is regretting leaving 1 direction pretty much bashing Zayn like the SUN Always does
20406	zayn	UNKNOWN	All of these commercials about Zayn in the vmas... we may never know until Sunday
20407	zayn	UNKNOWN	All the boys tweeted Liam For the b-day apart from Zayn, C'mon @zaynmalik WE WANT 4/4 #HappyBirthdayLiam #Ziam http://t.co/WpQa6e3M5A
20408	zayn	UNKNOWN	And they're gonna do a joke where someone from the cast tries to take Zayn's spot and I'm going to laugh angrily  https://t.co/qPzjThwYNG
20409	zayn	UNKNOWN	Auzzie is really proud of being the 2nd person to comment on zayn's nipples when that cover came out lol
20410	zayn	UNKNOWN	But whatever The Sun says ( well most) come out true  And most media said Zayn will leave, he did  Baby rumours are confirmed by Louis
20411	zayn	UNKNOWN	Casually drops this in memory of Zayn since the 1st MV w/o him dropped yesterday #DragMeDownMusicVideo https://t.co/rWndyr7Zcy
20412	zayn	UNKNOWN	Changed my field hockey number from 5 to 4 bc Zayn left but if the unthinkable happens this March I guess I'm gonna be number 0
20413	zayn	UNKNOWN	Did you hear about Zayn leaving One Direction "That's so March 25th dad"
20414	zayn	UNKNOWN	Do u ever cry over ZAYN for a lite and then it seems like March all over again bc same
20415	zayn	UNKNOWN	Funny how people believe the sun when it's about Zayn, though, isn't it lol f u
20416	zayn	UNKNOWN	Had a full conversation about Zayn leaving One Direction with my education professor in front of the whole class today. Happy Wednesday
20417	zayn	UNKNOWN	Hollywire tv wtf wednesday talking about zayn's twitter feud is quite relevant
20418	zayn	UNKNOWN	I can't believe tomorrow im seeing the loml's again for the 3rd time but Zayn won't be there and I didn't even think about that.
20419	zayn	UNKNOWN	I don't think ZAYN is getting enough sun no wonder he hasn't tweeted yet
20420	zayn	UNKNOWN	I find it's hilarious. Directioners use 22, I mean Taylor song and anything related with the MV to celebrate Zayn's 22nd bday.
20421	zayn	UNKNOWN	I hope Zayn isn't hanging out with May because she's been trying to start shit with his life for years.
20422	zayn	UNKNOWN	I hope they're not suggesting calvin and Zayn fighting because let's face it...Zayn may be tiny but he's got fast hands
20423	zayn	UNKNOWN	I met Harry, Liam and Niall on 26 March, the day right after Zayn announced he's leaving, the boys looked heartbroken #5monthswithoutzayn
20424	zayn	UNKNOWN	I opened this account on March 25th when Zayn left, since then I've meet some amazing people who share the same love with 1D.
20425	zayn	UNKNOWN	I really don't want to believe the sun but i after Zayn's leaving and all the drama, I just can't help but think if it's true
20426	zayn	UNKNOWN	I really want Justin to take a picture with Kendall,Miley,Ariana and Zayn on Sunday
20427	zayn	UNKNOWN	I still have trust issues towards Zayn's Instagram. Yes, it may be his, but I really don't think he's the one posting it.
20428	zayn	UNKNOWN	I still remember like 3 years ago.  Zayn told Harry that he was leaving the band on February 30th but he was joking and he said Harry cried+
20429	zayn	UNKNOWN	I think the boys may have thinking about Zayn at the #OTRAPhiladelphia when they sang Fresh Prince Bel Air
20430	zayn	UNKNOWN	I visited zayn's twitter and i saw " 21st of august watch it out girls :)" and suddenly gone and it return to his first tweet wtf
20431	zayn	UNKNOWN	I will give more solo dm with Zayn tomorrow, so stay active and turn notifs on. :) x
20432	zayn	UNKNOWN	I'm dreading all the press tomorrow saying Hair is about Zayn when IT WAS WRITTEN WAY BEFORE THEY BROKE UP

20434	zayn	UNKNOWN	I'm surprised it took this long after Zayn left for this to happen.  https://t.co/6mEm3A3ala
20435	zayn	UNKNOWN	If I see Zayn on Sunday I think I will pass the fuck out !
20436	zayn	UNKNOWN	If the rumours I'm hearing are true, this next batch of NXT hires may actually be better than the "NXT Kliq"(Owens,Balor,Itami,Zayn,Neville)
20437	zayn	UNKNOWN	If you ever wanna believe The Sun just remeber that they once wrote about Zayn and Louis secretly getting married in Thailand...
20438	zayn	UNKNOWN	If you would have told 7th grade Eleni that I would go see one direction in America without Zayn.. I'd probably think that you were lying
20439	zayn	UNKNOWN	Imagine Zayn comes out on the 2nd part of CFMF
20440	zayn	UNKNOWN	Is anyone else reading that Zayn may be performing at the VMAs with The Weeknd? I'm not emotionally ready for that.
20441	zayn	UNKNOWN	Is it true that Zayn might be performing tomorrow at the VMAS
20442	zayn	UNKNOWN	It remind me to Zayn when he said there's one missing #MTVHottest One Direction https://t.co/5c4AESCjMJ
20443	zayn	UNKNOWN	It was nice of @onedirection to break this news on a Sunday and not while I'm sitting at work like they did with Zayn. That was rude.
20444	zayn	UNKNOWN	It's like when Zayn said he was just taking a break all over again.. https://t.co/YiNXGYgIlX
20445	zayn	UNKNOWN	It's the 21st of August istg if the reason why Zayn isn't tweeting is because he's got something in store for us in this specific day....

20450	zayn	UNKNOWN	Liams new tattoo is the number 25, do you know when Zayn left? March 25th so that must mean...  Ziam is real.
20451	zayn	UNKNOWN	March 15: media frenzy over the Ziam kiss  March 25: Zayn quits one direction.  Y'ALL REALLY GONNA SAY THIS ISNT WEIRD ?
20452	zayn	UNKNOWN	March 25 : OTRA Jakarta, my OTRA March 25 : Zayn officially left 1D  see the struggle?! #5monthswithoutzayn
20453	zayn	UNKNOWN	March 28 will be the first One Direction's concert without Zayn as member. They'll sing at a sold out stadium, over 90,000 fans!
20454	zayn	UNKNOWN	Maria thinks Harry is gonna leave the band in January and collab with Zayn on like 5 albums  and then maybe works with naughty boy same
20455	zayn	UNKNOWN	Must stop Zayn at all costs from going  https://t.co/kwpX3ZHvFq
20456	zayn	UNKNOWN	OMG.OMG. can't wait guys,it's tomorrow!Don't think about how Zayn's not there.It's his fault,not ours!Remember that. #DragMeDownMusicVideo

20463	zayn	UNKNOWN	See you guys will go on the defense when the sun says ANYTHING about 1D, but they say something about Zayn ya'll believe in a heartbeat wtf
20464	zayn	UNKNOWN	Since Midnight Memories, I knew that Zayn will be the 1st to left, I watched almost all of their performance &amp; Zayn is not that into them.
20465	zayn	UNKNOWN	Someone on my TL just tweeted that Liam is the 2nd oldest member of 1D nd I was about to correct her before I remembered that Zayn quit
20466	zayn	UNKNOWN	Sometimes I forget Zayn left one direction, and then when the realisation hits and it's 25th March all over again
20467	zayn	UNKNOWN	Soo apparently I've been dared by @Silvana76429890 to not talk about the boys or Zayn for a whole day tomorrow I can't even rt them or anyth
20468	zayn	UNKNOWN	Tbh. Drag me down music video was so good that I didn't notice Zayn was missing until the 4th time I watched it
20469	zayn	UNKNOWN	The Sun has been trying to push this whole "End of 1D" mantra since Zayn left so they can get credit for being the first to say it
20470	zayn	UNKNOWN	The Sun is bullshit 99% of the time but they're the ones who said Louis is gonna be a dad and Zayn left and look what happened
20471	zayn	UNKNOWN	The sun look more hurt about zerries break up than zayn and Perrie
20472	zayn	UNKNOWN	Their first music video without Zayn and it may just be their best one yet. #DragMeDownVevoRecord

20479	zayn	UNKNOWN	Vma's might be using Zayn for promo or may be he is actually going.
20480	zayn	UNKNOWN	Wait but when Zayn left we got a Facebook statement now the whole band is separating and we don't get anything just an article from the sun
20481	zayn	UNKNOWN	Well...looks like One Direction has finally decided to end the standoff. Thanks for the free Zayn promo though! https://t.co/NHdmdhDpY2

20484	zayn	UNKNOWN	When Zayn sees niall bc N always changes subject when he gets questioned about Z, so he talks about their 5th album https://t.co/myxAUDmpir
20485	zayn	UNKNOWN	When they sing the chorus all together after Zayn's 2nd solo in 18 is where it all goes down hill
20486	zayn	UNKNOWN	When you claim to see the sun light, but it turns out to be a flashlight. Just bc Zayn left doesn't mean they'll break up. #OhNoTheSun
20487	zayn	UNKNOWN	When you feel like Zayn is going to follow you soon and end of the day you're like well maybe tomorrow
20488	zayn	UNKNOWN	Who does Louis hate more Zayn or Harry the world may never know
20489	zayn	UNKNOWN	Why do you spread lies? Zayn still has his IG https://t.co/Lz24k3lXF7
20490	zayn	UNKNOWN	Why is May Vaseline talking about Zayn like they're best friends?
20491	zayn	UNKNOWN	Why would the sun publish such a big announcement of 1D splitting up and not like what they did with Zayn on FB?
20492	zayn	UNKNOWN	Wouldnt 1D have posted a facebook statement first like what they did with Zayn? This is big news and it's just being reported by The Sun
20493	zayn	UNKNOWN	Yeah, everything is Zayn's fault.Even if we get a hurricane tomorrow, it's gonna be Zayn's fault.u guys r disgusting https://t.co/edsHJw7q0t
