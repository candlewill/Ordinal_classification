For this submission, we first trained several different neural nets creating
various models. 
These models were combined using a random forest in order to gain better
robustness.
We trained several different convolutional neural nets by first doing a
distant-supervised phase, 
where we used emoticons as labels. This was done using up to 90M tweets.
In a second phase, we used the provided supervised data (train + dev 2013 +
2016 data) to further train the model.
The CNN was initialized using custom made word2vec embeddings based on these
90M tweets.
The neural nets differed in their choice of filter shapes, pooling shapes and
usages of hidden layers.
We used Theano to create our nnet.
