- 5.1 Core approach
	We trained 2 convolutional nnets in 2 phases. A distant supervised pahse using 90M tweets and the smileys as positive/negative label. 
	A supervised pahse where we used the 2016 train data. We tuned on the 2016 devtest. 
	After that we combined the prediction probabilities of the 2 nnets by simple averaging.
	The convolutional nnets are based on custom word2vec embeddings trained on the 90M tweets. There are the imputs.

- 5.2 Supervised or unsupervised
	Distant supervised and supervised

- 5.3 Important/interesting/novel features used
	We used a 2 layer convolutional nnet. We trained on lots of data which helped to get a good increase in F1 score. 
	One of the 2 nnets used pos/neut/negative distant labels inferred from the tweets.

- 5.4 Important/interesting/novel tools used
	We based everything on theano framework. We used GPUs to gain a very significant speedup.

- 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing
	Creationg custom word2vec embeddings based on the 90M is crucial, doing this we gained about 5 points in contrast to using pre-made glove embeddings.

- 5.6 Other data used (outside of the provided)
	We used about 90M tweets provided by sheffield.

- 5.7 Size of the training Twitter data used (some teams could only download part of the data)
	For task B and D we used about 5000 tweets (train 2016 and dev 2016 datasets combined)

- 5.8 Did you participate in SemEval-2013 task 2? No 

- 5.9 Did you participate in SemEval-2014 task 9? No

- 5.10 Did you participate in SemEval-2015 task 10? Some of us did.
