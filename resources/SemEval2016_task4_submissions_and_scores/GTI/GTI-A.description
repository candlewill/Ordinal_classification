5. System specs

- 5.1 Core approach: We propose an NLP approach that includes pre-processing, tokenisation and POS tagging of texts to then obtain the syntactic structures of sentences by means of a dependency parser. 
The resulting syntactic structures are then used to determine message- and phrase-level polarities using only linguistical features, such as intensification or negation. Then, the information extracted is used as features of a supervised system.

- 5.2 Supervised or unsupervised: supervised

- 5.3 Important/interesting/novel features used: We use lexical and syntactical structures

- 5.4 Important/interesting/novel tools used: Freeling tagger and parser, Weka

- 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing: Hashtag, mention and entities recognition

- 5.6 Other data used (outside of the provided): Socal dictionary for English

- 5.7 Size of the training Twitter data used (some teams could only download part of the data): 14269
