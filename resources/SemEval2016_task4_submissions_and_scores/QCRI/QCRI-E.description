- 5.1 Core approach

We devised a novel algorithm for ordinal quantification whose main ingredients
are: i) n binary classifiers, where the j-th classifier returns the probability
for an example to belong to classes x <= j; ii) an algorithm for arranging the
n classifiers into a hierarchical structure, i.e. a "quantification" tree. 
The tree is built using information on the ordering of the target classes and
provides a way to combine the probabilities of the binary classifiers to get
the probability for each example to belong to any of the n+1 target classes. 
Finally, a Probabilistic Classify and Count (PCC) technique is used to combine
the probabilities of the examples to get a quantification value for each class.

- 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing

Feature vectors are built using the approach described in (Kiritchenko et al., 2014, Section
