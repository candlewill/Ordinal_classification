630817148751978496	zlatan	@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
630820977346150400	zlatan	Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
631192740089311232	zlatan	@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
632489375708905472	zlatan	@Paulkurth that 3rd shot looks like its from a Michael Bay movie. Zlatan just revealed himself to be Optimus prime.
632604790720217089	zlatan	@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
632806342382653440	zlatan	7 more days till we start the campaign that will win us our 19th scudetto ! Zlatan or no Zlatan that trophy is ours. #ForzaMilan
632816067757350912	zlatan	The VP of France's refereeing union Laurent Ugo has said he accepts Zlatan's apology following the striker's rant at officials on Sunday.

634032590077460480	zlatan	OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen
634321834171699200	zlatan	Zlatan , will your perfumes make me perform overhead kicks .&lt;3 https://t.co/q9tVV95mlr
634847150510227460	zlatan	Sun are so full of shit they say PSG trying to replace Zlatan with Neymar hahaha
635032745241112576	zlatan	Reserving the right to put Milan 3rd if Zlatan arrives
635166727651856384	zlatan	Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg
635179934365941760	zlatan	@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
635220412155105280	zlatan	@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
635924485753991169	zlatan	The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)
636025757672820736	zlatan	I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
636255247992758272	zlatan	@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore

637711360416198656	zlatan	@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc
637722964432146432	zlatan	We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news

638013292036923392	zlatan	Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
638018562334916609	zlatan	Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
638033582112534529	zlatan	Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
638090040254574592	zlatan	If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
638405789993017344	zlatan	If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.
638445576212754433	zlatan	Ok ed let's do this, Zlatan, greizmann and Laporte tomorrow make it happen
638531837313306624	zlatan	Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD
639016598477651968	zlatan	@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
640276909633486849	zlatan	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
640296841725235200	zlatan	Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
